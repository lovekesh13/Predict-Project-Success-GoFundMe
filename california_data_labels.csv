Only two weeks ago, the students finally returned to their campus that has been outfitted with portable classroom.  For the previous 50 days post-fire, daily classes were held between several local churches in Santa Rosa. Whether near the confessional, auditorium, or even in a storage shed, the students resiliently reported daily for their lessons.

My name is Toby Proescher, and I own Events To The 'T', Inc. and sfproms.com . I have the pleasure of hosting over 100 yearly proms for many schools across the Bay Area and have been the Cardinal Newman prom event planner for 6 years now. Our hearts broke the morning we read that the Cardinal Newman campus had been devastated by the fire, and 620 students would be adversely affected. This recent article highlights the adversity the football team overcame to make it to the NCS Championships
  http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22358016/cardinal-newman-football-california-wildfires-destroy-school 

Three weeks after the fire, I contacted the principal Mr. Graham Rutherford to find out if they were planning on continuing with prom, or if they wanted to cancel without any penalties. As soon as I heard him say 'yes we are going to give them a prom' I smiled and let him know that we would be doing everything for free, and starting this campaign on their behalf. As a Catholic school, they cannot solicit donations, but we can for them!

The Cardinal Newman prom is scheduled for Sunday, April 29, 2018 at the  http://www.bentlyreserve.com  in San Francisco. McCall's Catering will be providing delicious food, and the event will feature a live disc jockey, caricaturists, and a photo booth. We anticipate approximately 250-280 student attendees and guests from neighboring schools.

I would love to be able to tell all of the students this year that they don't have to pay for their prom tickets. In the case that we don't raise the entire amount, that the tickets will be inexpensive. Should we exceed our goal, the additional funds will be applied to possible upgrades such as dinner service and paying for the bus transportation.

As soon as Lindsay had word of a fire breaking out in Calistoga near Tubbs Lane, she immediately left her home in Santa Rosa and jumped into her truck to make her way to us. It was almost midnight. She left her best friend Riley asleep in the safety of her home in Coffee Park in Santa Rosa, she would never think of bringing her dog into fire danger. When she crested the hill and stopped at Equi-Ed to pick up a four horse trailer to bring to us in Calistoga, she was approached by CHP who informed her that the fire was raging towards Santa Rosa and that she needed turn around and go back. She had the presence of mind to hitch up the trailer and take 4-of the Equi-Ed horses down the hill with her to safety. She then headed to Cloverleaf Farm in Santa Rosa and led 20 of their horses out of an enclosed wooden barn into open pastures and arenas. We now know that the barn burned to the ground. When she turned behind her she saw the flames coming towards her. She ran to her truck and headed to her home in Coffee Park only to find her neighborhood was on fire, she had only minutes/seconds to get Riley out. 

She and Riley escaped but only by minutes. She instinctually grabbed her camp gear which is always ready to go and headed to the Coast, making calls along the way to wake her friends and family and alert them of the fire danger. It was 2:00 a.m. Her house and everything she owned burned to the ground that night. 

Lindsay set up camp at the Coast and has not skipped one beat in helping Sunrise Horse Rescue and horses all over the Napa & Sonoma Valleys get to Safety. 

She has not paused to think of her own loss. Instead, she has been mobilizing teams of horse haulers and has been coordinating efforts to get horses to safety day after day without much sleep or the comfort of her home.

Their narrow escape was captured in dramatic police body-cam video now featured on CNN Anderson Cooper 360 , ABC , NBC  and more.

SUSAN DOBRA:
Susan is a writer and teacher at California State University, Chico. She lived with her partner of 18 years in Paradise, California, where they sang together, grew organic vegetables, hosted a weekly open mic, and participated in a range of community service orgs until the wildfires of Nov 8th ripped through town and burned their home to the ground. She and her partner narrowly escaped the flames.

MATT PLOTKIN:
Matt was a youth pastor in Paradise for several years and is now the acting chair of the Butte County Camp Fire Long Term Recovery Group. Over 52,000 people have been displaced by these wildfires. 

AUDREY DENNEY 
Audrey is an educator and farmer and was the Democratic challenger of Rep. Doug LaMalfa (CA-01) in 2018.  CA-01 encompasses the 11 counties in the northeast corner of California (including Paradise) and is a historic conservative stronghold.  Audrey is working on disaster response and long term recovery for the Camp Fire which devastated the county where she lives.

ABOUT THE WILD FIRES:
There have been over 88 confirmed casualties, with hundreds still missing, over 18,000 homes destroyed, and over 52,000 Climate Refugees displaced, with threats of mudslides and ongoing health challenges with noravirus outbreaks in the temporary shelters for wildfire survivors. Since the 1980s, climate change has doubled the area of forest in the U.S. considered vulnerable to fire—and research shows this will only grow.

WHAT FUNDS RAISED WILL COVER:
We're raising funds to help subsidize basic travel costs (primarily flights) to help send this coalition of 7 wildfire survivors from Sacramento to Washington D.C. Flights cost about $600 per person.  *We have secured donated housing for everyone - thank you!*

Any funds raised that exceed final travel costs will be donated to NGOs supporting survivors of the fires. If we fall short of our goal, we will subsidize travel costs as much as we can.

The Camp Fire that engulfed the town of Paradise, CA and surrounding areas on November 8, 2018 has been called the largest and most destructive/deadly wildfire in California history. My own family has been affected. My cousin, her husband and young daughter thankfully escaped safely, but they lost their home. Their story, and that of thousands of working-class families in this area are what is driving my passion for this cause. I know my friends, family and colleagues here at Watkins feel the same!

After all, At Watkins Wellness the Watkins Way drives us all to value our relationships with each other. Many Watkins families have been affected by California wildfires and as the Watkins family, we want to help!

Watkins is raising funds to support the North Valley Community Foundation's Camp Fire Relief Fund.  https://www.nvcf.org/. This is a local organization in Chico, CA who is committed to supporting those specifically affected by this tragedy.  99% of proceeds they collect will go directly to the victims. With thousands displaced, they need our support.

Not only of her home, but of her business, her livelihood, as well. Connie is resilient and optimistic but the realities of life are that she will need to rebuild from the ashes. She now has to figure out how to survive until insurance issues are settled and she can get back to making a living.

Additionally, Thanksgiving Together will provide evacuees at all official shelters with a Thanksgiving meal at the shelters themselves.

On Thursday, November 8th the city of Paradise was struck by what is now the most destructive and deadliest wildfire in California history. As of today, the following Tuesday, 7,600 structures have been destroyed, the vast majority of which are people's’ homes. The blaze has consumed 125,000 acres and is only 30% contained. Forty-two people have lost their lives and 200 remain missing. The blaze continues to threaten nearby cities including Chico , located right at the fire’s western edge.



  
Serving the video making community for 30 years, Videomaker has found an incredibly supportive home in Chico, California. This community has also allowed One Mobile Projector per Trainer (OMPT) to grow from a dream by Videomaker’s founder into an organization that provides aid to neglected populations throughout the developing world. The small-town closeness of Chico and Paradise has never been as apparent as it has the past few days. 

Videomaker and OMPT Staff members are hosting friends and family displaced by the fire. Business are opening their doors to evacuees. Food and clothing drives are overflowing with supplies. Chico might not be the tech hotspot one might expect for an international magazine like Videomaker or a nonprofit like OMPT, but we wouldn’t trade it for anything else.



The impact of this blaze has been felt throughout the local community, including the shared offices of Videomaker and OMPT. A quarter of our staff have been displaced by the fire and several lost their homes. In an effort to do our part in providing support for our community, Videomaker and OMPT are asking for donations for our co workers impacted by this devastating blaze. Any money raised will go directly towards supporting affected Videomaker and OMPT staff, contributors and community members.

All donations are tax deductible, and go directly to the Golden Valley Bank Community Foundation before being distributed to those with the greatest need. 100% of the funds will go directly to victims of the Camp Fire.

Even if you’re unable to contribute financially, simply sharing this campaign and message among your friends and family can go a long way.

Her “disability” is nothing to her - she still goes to work 5-6 days a week, cleans her own home & drives herself with no assistance needed. Unfortunately, medical issues (not related to her legs) have forced Irus into ICU twice in less than 6 months.  Any sick time she had available through employment was exhausted with her 8 day stay in June 2018. On the morning of 11 November 2018, Irus  was at her job, ready to work - although the air was thick with smoke from the Northern California wildfires & she was having trouble breathing - she had a seizure, fell out of her wheelchair & temporarily lost consciousness in respiratory crisis. 911 was called immediately, and as the paramedics  were bagging her for oxygen, she aspirated - which would cause further complications. Iris  is currently being kept heavily sedated - the hospital staff tried to decrease sedation on the 3rd day & she started having small seizures. (5 days as of this writing) and she is still in ICU. 
All of this has sent Iris into a spiraling financial nightmare. Once out of the hospital in June, she was unable to return to work for two weeks. She received a small amount from disability, but it was just the beginning of looming financial disaster. Because Iris has wanted to remain as independent as possible, she returned to work before she should have.  Medical, mortgage, insurance bills already mounting, Iris became officially in financial crisis.  Now this second medical emergency hit her - Iris is facing foreclosure of her home,  further loss of independence, loss of  her beloved companion cat, and quite possibly her employment.  All of these problems, not to mention, she is driving a van that is barely drivable.

Jake and his fellow med students are currently living with only the clothes they wore to school.  Currently they live on an air mattresses at various friends homes while trying to remain optimistic and focused on college. 

What effects one of us effects all of us please help in giving to this fund.  While we are all comfortable at home many people have lost their homes leaving them with nothing. 

The funds raised from GoFundMe will go immediately to Jake and the other students and families who have reached out to me finding themselves EMBARRASSED but in need.  These funds will provide essentials to rebuilding their lives. Things we all take for granted such as clothes, towels, wash clothes, soap, blankets, sheets, pillows, personal hygiene items, home goods, diapers, toys, school supplies, backpacks, etc.

He built this home before there was even a building department in the county and because it now is considered ""non-conventional"" he could never get home owners insurance for it. 

When they originally got evacuated, they went to stay at a friends but got a knock on the door at 4am telling them to leave right away and their house burned down too. They were then heading to a friends house in West Point, California to stay in a tent in a friends back yard, but the fire kicked them out of there too.  They are now ""camping"" in a tent at a camp ground at Lake Hogan which is now their home--everything they have is now just a tent or fits into a small tent.  

They have received confirmation that the fire did take their home, a neighbor saw flames come in from 2 sides but they are not able to get back yet to see extent of the devastation.  I am asking everyone I know to please, please, give what you can to help them--every penney will help!!

Although they will absolutely need money to rebuild so they are not homeless forever, at this point, they need even basic things like shoes, clothes, toilettries, etc.  They have literally LOST IT ALL!  Here's a link to see a local news video on the fire:

Except for one family who purchased one goat, all of the other bidders were ranchers and meat farmers who were looking to purchase animals for slaughter. 



(Goats at the livestock auction.)



We released these goats to a small family-owned business called Goats R Us. Terri and Aegon are the founders of Goats R Us and they have spent their whole lives saving and taking care of animals. Their family owns multiple ranches and over 10,000 goats! These goats ""work"" by clearing vegetation around the Bay Area to prevent wildfires.


In 2017, a total of 9,133 fires burned 1,381,405 acres in California. The goats that we rescue will spend their lives grazing on the beautiful Californian hillsides, working to to prevent more deadly fires in the future.
 


(Goats R Us goats, happily grazing in Hercules, California. Photo by Selena Hao)

Terri and Aegon so kindly agreed to give these goats a good home, to provide them with experienced care and regular medical attention. Goat R Us transports their goats to different areas around the San Francisco Bay Area to clear brush on the Californian hillsides.

Later when the goats ""retire,"" they will roam and graze on Terri, Aegon, and their family's beautiful land. When these goats become elderly, they will not be sold and killed for their meat. They will be given the best of medical care and allowed to live out their natural lives. Terri and Aegon's ranch is also home to Tibetan yaks, a camel, llamas, ducks, sheep, chickens, rabbits, cats, pigs, as well as specially trained dogs that protect these animals from wild predators.

Last year we were able to save 318 goats! 

Together we were able to raise over $34,000 to save these goats!

This year we want to save as many goats as we can!

Goats R Us has kindly offered us the use of their livestock trucks so that we can safely transport as many animals as we need.

Please give whatever you can to support this worthy cause. These goats will certainly be killed otherwise.

Last year we paid an average of $150 for each goat. We will be purchasing the goats from auction where they are sold by the pound, so the price may vary from to goat to goat. 

Please give whatever you are able to. 

Your donations will be tax-deductible. 

Also you can help by sharing our fundraising page and spreading the word!

With the funds that we collect, we will save as many goats as we are able to purchase. If there is any money left over, we will save it for next year's release and we will also make a small donation to Goats R Us to help with the goats' vaccinations and medicines.

This year’s goat release is tentatively planned for the beginning of September.

If you would like to contribute, please consider donating well before that date to give us time for the funds to be cleared and collected from GoFundMe.


(Last year's goat release with Venerable Lingtrul Rinpoche leading prayers for the rescued animals and all sentient beings.

Last year's release would not have been possible without the blessings and support of His Holiness Kathok Getse Rinpoche, who also contributed a large amount of his own funds to our cause. Venerable Lingtrul Rinpoche initiated this campaign and thanks to his blessings, constant support and tireless effort we were able to save these animals from certain death. Of course, these releases would not have been possible without the kindness and hard work of Terri and Aegon’s family and the folks at Goats R Us, who gave these rescued goats a wonderful home and loving care and helped us at every step of the way. Terri and Aegon also contributed their own funds to this cause. A heartfelt thank you to Lynda Isenberg for her deep generosity and kindess . A very deep thank you to our many kind donors and supporters, together we were able to save 318 goats by raising $34,000.!

Please consider donating this year so that we may save many more lives from slaughter. 


Your donation will save innocent animals from being slaughtered and allow them to live out their lives with excellent care and medical attention. These goats will ""work"" to prevent deadly wildfires in California by grazing the hillsides, reducing brush and overgrowth of vegetation. 

Thank you so much and may all beings benefit.

I was given a project in my literature class to do something kind to someone’s life somehow. Being a 17 year old girl, going through my own life troubles, I thought “well what am I supposed to do”? “How can I change someone’s life for the better”? Then it came to me, all of the things I’ve been hearing on the news about California and the uncontrollable fires spreading around. I remembered when I was in kindergarten my family had experienced a very bad fire in which we had lost all of our baby pictures and all of our youth memories. Growing up in a big family memories really mean a lot to us, and loosing all of those memories really took a toll on us. Because of this I can really feel for the families in California and everyone loosing there homes,pets,personal items etc. I began to really start thinking this project through, I really want to do something big, not just for one person but a community of people in need. This is a kind of project I would like to carry out for the rest of my life, always try and find a way to help somebody else and change their life or situation. My plan is to collect donations for areas in need, especially in times of crisis. I’d like to start with California and continue on updating the cause as I go. The money donated to this campaign will go directly to disaster relief centers, shelters, and other places in need of food and supplies. I know I am only one young person of billions in the world, but I believe that people should really come together more especially in times for crisis and help each other. People need people, people need love and compassion, and if I can do it then maybe it’ll create a domino effect, causing other people to do good to others. If everyone puts an effort to make their mark on the world and work together on important issues, then I believe slowly but surely the world can become a better place.

As many of you may know, the California wildfires have destroyed the homes of thousands.  My sister, Lisa and her husband Kirk were one of the many families who lost everything they own in Paradise.  They had to flee their home early Thursday morning, at one point on bicycles with their fur babies, Brandi and Bailey.  They lost their home, rental home, business, and two cars.

Kirk and Lisa have been living in Paradise for the past 21 years.  During those years, they become well known throughout their community.  They opened and operated a drive thru coffee shop for 21 years allowing them to get to know so many within their community.  Lisa has been working as an administrator with the local Feather River hospital for the past 11 years.  Both of them have given back to their community in service and love.  

They need help getting back on their feet.  Insurance claims for disasters such as this can take months if not years.  The money raised will be used to buy essentials and everyday expenses, things we take for granted day in and day out.  We want to help them feel as comfortable and loved as possible during this time of uncertainty.  

Often times it is difficult to comfort others after such a tragedy.  One way we can show our love and support is by making a donation to ease their stress.   This has been a tragic loss and they are devastated.  Any contribution and your help by re-posting would be greatly appreciated.

All money raised will go directly to Jane, minus Go-Fund-Me's platform fee  of 5 percent,  a 2.9 percent fee

Patty Donofrio (nee Patty Puckett), who spent her most recent years in Chesterton Indiana, moved to Paradise California in 2017 taking everything she owned with her, excited about her new adventure out West.

Divorced and retired, with two precious kitties, she moved out West to the Golden State. 

Beginning on November 8th, California's Wildfires hit hard! What is now known as the ""Camp Fire"", completely destroyed the entire town of Paradise, where Patty lived, and along with several other major Wildfires, totally burned other cities and communities across the state. The death total is currently 101 with nearly 1,000 still missing (as of November 18, 2018). Homes and businesses are gone, thousands displaced, animals injured or killed.

Dear Friends and Family,

My name is Jessica Kitavi. I am from Rohnert Park, CA and I am a cousin to Marion Heim.

My cousin, Marion Heim and her husband Lloyd Heim lost their home this past Monday due to the Tubbs fire  on Monday, October 9th, 2017.  They lost everything  and were left with  only the clothes on their back. This has been a very difficult time for them.   They have lived in the North Bay for the past 45 years  and have two daughters named Astrid and Adrienne. They just moved to their new home in Santa Rosa  last year in August 2016.

They need money for basic supplies and additional expenses( e.g. clothing, food, gas for transportation, and hotel expenses) since they lost everything, and also for the future when they are looking for a new place they will need help with the finances that are involved with moving into a new home. (e.g. the monthly payments associated with a new home).

I am collecting money on behalf of Marion Heim. Any money that you donate to me will be transferred to her account. If you would prefer to write a check rather than use go fund me, you can write a check payable to Marion Heim and I will deposit the check into her account.  If you are unable to give me the check in person, then you can mail it to me and I can deposit it that way. Please send me a message if you'd like the mailing address.

Anything that you're able to give  will be greatly appreciated by them.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

My name is Stephen Diaz and last April we sold our Chico, CA photo booth business to a friend and fellow photographer from the neighboring town of Paradise, CA.




Kyle Nelson, who purchased the photo booth business, recently had his house burn down with everything inside...




Kyle was excited about the photo booth business because it fit perfectly into his existing studio and provided an additional stream of income on the weekends. His wife and he had a young son and the dream was that with this new business they'd be able to have some extra savings to spend more time as a family.




On November 8th a massive fire broke out in Northern California that destroyed the entire town of Paradise, CA including Kyle's home.









As of writing this on 11/19, here's the #Campfire stats: 




• 150,000 acres burned
• 65 percent contained
• 77 fatalities confirmed
• 993 people unaccounted for
• 12,794 structures destroyed




Those numbers are unimaginable to most, but take a look at this aerial image below and imagine if this was your town, your neighborhood, your streets. Here is a video  that shows some footage from the town of Paradise. It's absolutely devastating.










Let's Help Kyle Restart...




Kyle's family lost EVERYTHING, but I wanted to create a GoFundMe specifically for Kyle to help him purchase a replacement photo booth ASAP. He has winter holiday party bookings and future weddings but his booth, printer, props and backdrops all burned in the fire. Unfortunately since the business was a fairly new purchase, it was not on his insurance policy yet.




Your Financial Contributions Will Directly Towards Getting Kyle Back in Business...

• Donate $5, the amount you'd spend on a daily coffee (there is power in numbers and every little will make a difference!)




• Donate $50, and cover some of the paper/ink that was lost (many boxes). This is the paper and ink that the booth prints memories for guests on. These are the prints that will hang on people's fridges and walls for years to come.




• Donate $100, and help replace some of the props that always brought smiles to the photo booth guests. This booth was known for it's amazing props and every year after Halloween we'd go stock up for the whole year.




• Donate $200 to help replace a backdrop (there were about 10 that burned in the fire). Each backdrop is a different color and allows clients to customize the booth to fit right into their event.

• Donate $450 to cover one weekend of Photo Booth income lost. While the booth is out of commission, Kyle is loosing potential income during these months.




• Donate $600 and cover a new iPad. This is what goes in the booth to help run the photo booth software.




• Donate $750 and cover the new DSLR camera that will take photos.

• Donate $1000 and cover Kyle's new printer for the booth.




I'm really excited to see our community come together and get Kyle and his photo booth business back in action as SOON as possible. The above estimated amounts are just a fraction of the photo booth expenses  and are just for inspiration, please consider donating any amount out of the generosity of your heart! Thank you in advance.

Thankfully, Anthony made it out of town just in time with his two dogs.

As a Louisianaian, we have dealt with various devastating natural disasters (i.e. Hurricane, Flood), now it's time to lend a helping hand. 

There are also elderly couples and families with kids that need your help. 






With combined efforts we can raise more for each family and get some of the necessities that they need.  To cast a wider net, this fund will also support and help families who have lost family members, animals, homes, employment, or belongings.

Any amount will be grateful! We appreciate you and your efforts. 

If you don't have the funds, sharing is awesome too! 

If you're able to volunteer time, please reach out at louisianaloveforever@gmail.com

All fire fighting and emergency services are being dedicated to life preservation, with none available to put out the fires.

More will be evacuated and more will need a helping hand. Likely more than anyone can predict right now.

Please donate! The funds will go toward providing resources to California Wildfires, and resources to those who have been misplaced or who's homes and livelihood have been completely destroyed. 

In addition to donating, please contribute by sharing information on who is taking in the most refugees and needs resources most promptly.

My name is Sue Ellen Bullock and I am a longtime friend of Jen Tracey-Cashman’s. We were remote co-workers at TIGI and we have built a friendship over the years. Jen is one of the best friends I have ever had. She has selflessly shared the best moments of her life - meeting Ryan, a cross-country move, the best wedding I’ve ever attended, babies, motherhood, marriage, our careers, life, laughter, and love. 

This morning, I received a text from Jen. She was finally able to visit Paradise, CA again after she and her family fled due to the fires that destroyed Paradise and Chico this week. Her text said (and I quote): “My house is gone.” 

Everyone in her family is safe. However, their home, ALL of their possessions, family heirlooms, Ryan’s entire acupuncture practice is completely gone. It is difficult for me to even write this.

Aside from losing everything, they now have no means to make a living and provide for their family. Their entire community has been eliminated by the fires. 

Please help this family - anything you can. I don’t have an actual dollar amount goal but I want to make sure that all of Jen and Ryan’s friends and family can come together and help the people who would give the shirt off their backs to help even a stranger. This family is rebuilding from ground zero. They have two small children and it will be a long time before they have access to funds to find a home, clothing, money for basic needs, a safe place for their children to have schooling. 

Everything they know is gone. 

Everyone in the family is alive and safe. They were evacuated so fast, they had no time to grab anything - they just had to run for their lives. Anything helps. 

Ryan, Jen, Brady, Morgan, and Nova ~ You are SO strong. We all love you and we are so sorry this happened to you and your family. If you need anything, no request is too large. 

Every single dime is going to the family in their time of need. My only interest is to help a really good friend who has been loyal to me and needs a miracle. 

Thank you you for your consideration.

The California wildfires are no exception. Neal Diede, has recently lost his home in Paradise, California to the fire.

They watched their vehicle go up in flames. The house is also a total loss. They have literally lost everything. 

Prior to moving to California, Neal taught at the high school in Minot, North Dakota for 18 years. He is currently a ski instructor for children and adults in California. He and his girlfriend also run a business in Paradise. The status of the business in unknown at this time.

Being displaced from your home is bad enough, holiday season or otherwise – it’s even worse when you know there is nothing left of that home or vehicles.

Our goal is to preserve this unique piece of history in a way that encourages others who may find themselves in similar circumstances. Through our feature documentary and action campaign, our hope is to support the relief and rebuilding efforts in our community and beyond. 

On Sunday, October 8, 2017, during severe red-flag warning conditions, a series of wildfires broke out across Sonoma and Napa counties, ultimately burning over 160,000 acres, claiming 31 lives, and destroying over 7,800 structures before being fully extinguished on October 31st.

It was a devastating blow to our community.

As the dust settled, and the acute needs were less pronounced, I began doing the only thing I felt like I had to offer: photographing friends, and friends of friends in the fire zone where their homes used to be with the hope that it would give them a place to start the rebuilding process.

And so I went and met each family, photographing them on black and white film only, with the intention of coming back a year later to photograph them all again, this time in color, as a tribute to how far they’ve come. At the time, my intention for the work was to keep it entirely private, but after seeing the body of work and being encouraged to share these stories, I knew they had to be told.

When I look at these portraits and talk to these families, I am reminded of Kintsugi, a Japanese art form where broken ceramics are mended by gold. The belief is that the object is more beautiful for having been broken. Stronger too. And that the cracks are a tribute to it’s history.  

This project is my way of attempting to put gold in the cracks of our community and to honor these families and their unwavering resolve to remain unbroken. 

I have been trusted by every person I photographed, to be the keeper of their stories. As that keeper, and as someone who hopes to preserve this unique piece of history in a beautiful way, I am asking you for your help in keeping them alive. So that we can all remember, who we are, why we’re here, and that we are all stronger in our broken places. 

Our goal is to raise $30,000 by the first anniversary of the fire, on October 8th, 2018, which will make it possible to film a digital short during the one year anniversary photoshoots that will then be used to promote and raise additional funds needed to produce a full-length feature documentary and action campaign aimed to help first responders, relief, and rebuilding efforts.

Recovery is a marathon, not a sprint... so thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for being a part of our healing.

Nearly 6 weeks after Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico we are STILL in desperate need of your help. 
Much of the island still has no power, no water, limited access to food and drinking water and no phone or internet service to communicate with anyone living outside their immediate area.
After 6 weeks of helping family, neighbors, friends and anyone who I can reach get back on their feet I have exhausted my resources and am asking for your help to allow me to continue the work and reach out into the island where help is needed most. 
Picture 1: Roads blocked, power lines down, people stranded without water, power or food. No communication with the outside world. La Villa De Torrimar in Guaynabo.

Picture 2: In this picture from Rio Grande the winds blew in the windows and then sucked out closet doors. Many properties have been flooded and furniture destroyed but the power of the hurricane knocked down brick walls and sucked off roofs.

With your help I will continue to:
*Deliver food and essentials to families with limited access to this inside the island in the most hard hit areas.
*Continue to fill and transport 55 gallon drums of drinking water to families who do not have access to running water for drinking or bathing
*Continue to fill and transport diesel drums to those in need
*Provide help to those with generators that need oil, and filter changes.
*Deliver messages and food supplies between families who are separated from loved ones in the states and here. At my home we have communication, wifi and live right next to Cosco which is the only supermarket on the island (except Sams) with a good supply of meat, dairy and water .
*Clear and remove fallen trees and debris in areas that have still not been reached by emergency services of FEMA.

Why start now?
Even though its been 5 weeks since hurricane Maria hit I see very slow progress to get the island back to normalcy. Even with the US army helicopters and C10 airplanes in the sky en-mass they really are only scraping the surface. With FEMA stretched to the limit with Hurricane Harvey in Texas, Irma in the Caribbean and Florida and now the wildfires in California its hard to blame them for not giving us undivided attention. 
I see some progress but I have become more and more frustrated with how slow it is. For this reason I am taking matters into my own hands and helping the way I know best. 
The other reason I am only just starting is that it has taken me this long to get back on my feet. We are very lucky to have generator power in my home and mains water came back on day 5.  We have found the best place to get food is costco which is 4 minutes drive from my house. No other supermarkets seem to have fresh produce or consistant water or dairy products. Costco has been the best bet and continues to grow in options versus the other stores and supermarkets that in many cases don't have freezers or fridges that work.

Why give to my go fund me and not other organizations?
I am in the best position to help because of all the affected areas we are in the middle of the metro area with access to shops for food and water (without lines), diesel and gas without lines (as of last week)
I have a team of helpers experienced in working together.
I am 4 minutes drive from the best costco on the island for supplies
I have access tomains water and the means to transport it
I have cellphone signal and internet access.
My teambuilding company employees have years of experience producing social responsibility events for corporate America and we are already making an impact.

Success stories/achievemts so far:
*Loaned five 55 gallon drums that I usually use for my teambuilding events to those in need using them for water and diesel transfer and storage
*Delivered five 55 gallon drums full of diesel to those in need in the guaynabo area and filled them at my friends factory.
*cleared areas inundated with fallen trees and vegetation...see local park
*provided help changing filters and oil on generators to those who have them and need help with this service. 
*Gave away huge 40' x 40' taupaulins to someone who has nothing in the town of Luquillo on the east of the island.
*Gave away diapers, bottled water and clothing to neighbors collecting for the central island areas.",4483,500000,17,16,62,"GUAYNABO, PR"," October 22, 2017",,16,62,17,0.9959,5341,500000,0.008966,0,0,

                        Help For Lil Ollie's Dental Surgery",https://www.gofundme.com/surgeryforollie10,Help For Ollie's Surgery,"A few months ago, we made the decision to expand our family by one. In comes Ollie, the seven pound ball of fluff that we were fortunate enough to adopt from the Napa County Shelter.


Ollie was in the shelter for many months after being picked up off the streets. It's likely that he lost his home during the Northern California wildfires of late 2017. 

The shelter was very grateful for us adopting Ollie. They said he was undesired by most families because of his old age, his one working eye, and his extensive joint problems.


None of that mattered to us, because from the moment we met Ollie, he was the friendliest and most happy-go-lucky dog. You could tell he was just so grateful to be given a loving home.

In the beginning, things weren't so easy. Ollie was incredibly malnourished and thin, to the point where we were hesitant to pick him up because his ribs felt so prominent and bendable.


Ollie would practically inhale every morsel of food we gave him and he was very protective of himself. We couldn't even try to pet him or pick him up near his blind eye without him trying to bite us. 


He was also very reluctant to trust our first dog, Jasper. He wouldn't fall asleep near Jasper and would growl or try to bite Jasper for simply moving closer. 


Thankfully after many months and lots of love, Ollie is at a very healthy weight and has become the sweetest and most trusting dog we could ever imagine.


Don't be fooled by his one eye and old age, that doesn't slow him down one bit! You'll always find Ollie prancing around with his tail constantly wagging. The little guy is so rambunctious and definitely has a lot more life left in him.

He has brought infinite amounts of love and joy into our family, and we want nothing more than to return the favor. 


When Ollie was adopted, we were notified of the very poor condition of his teeth and gums, so we started saving up money to pay for a thorough dental cleaning.

More recently, Ollie has been in a lot of pain and is beginning to eat less and less. It turns out that he has numerous abscesses/infections that need to be taken care of as soon as possible. We are doing everything we can to make him feel more comfortable, but he will ultimately need this procedure to maintain the ability to eat.

After contacting over 50 veterinarians, we were given estimates upwards of $2500 for the dental surgery. 

Please help us give Ollie the greatest life the little guy deserves! 

Thank you for taking the time to read our story. 
If you are able to donate anything, it would be greatly appreciated.

In the midst of the evacuation, they grabbed a few items, but had to leave nearly everything behind.  They have the clothes on their backs and the car they drove to get away from the fires.  Everything else is gone. 
As many of you know, Pat attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and served our country for years before retiring from the military.  
He and I stayed close friends throughout all of our moves across the country and across the world.  We visited each other's homes and consider each other family.  
He and his family could use support right now.  They were in the process of selling this home and moving across the country for a new job opportunity, which adds even more complexity to the situation.  
Pat and I grew up together in Marblehead, OH and I now live in Denver, CO and will be giving the funds of this campaign to Pat Nissen through direct access to this account.  The money raised will be spent to help them replace items that they have lost, as well as assist them in their move to Maryland. I am sure the insurance process will be arduous and they will need money to help them obtain essentials as well as plant their new roots.

Wildfires anywhere on earth affects the entire earth....we're inside of a closed sphere, the smoke doesn't just disappear!

We're a company of mostly veterans who come from military families. We have dedicated our lives to defending and protecting our great nation.  The threats we faced in the military are similar to the threat we're facing now. Whether it's nuclear weapons or Wildfires, if we don't take steps to prevent the possible devastation, we could be looking at a cataclysmic event. Wildfires happen all over the world, but California is a great example of what the whole earth could experience in a few years if we don't prevent it.

Wildfire last year, just in California... 
-Destroyed 32,000 homes (Over 10,000 communities)
-Destroyed 4500 businesses
-Killed 43 civilians and 5 firefighters
-Killed 100's of pets and animals
-Took $5 Billion of taxpayers money to fight the fires and still caused $180 Billion in damages
-Released Billions of tons of poisonous smoke and gases into the atmosphere
-Affected areas across the U.S. and as far as Greenland

When California burns, the rest of the U.S. suffers!
-Cali contribute the most in federal taxes
-Cali's wine industry is #1 in the U.S. and 4th in the world with 
$35 Billion in sales in 2017
-Cali is the largest grower of produce in the U.S.
-Cali has the largest economy in the U.S. and the 8th in the world
-Hundreds of Billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayers money go to fighting the fires and rebuilding

Wildfires present us with a very upsetting paradox. While Wildfires are necessary to keep our oxygen/nitrogen producing forests healthy, they cause death and destruction if not controlled.

Wildfires kill way too many people and pets every year. They destroy thousands of homes, businesses, schools, churches...they destroy entire cities. Many families are left homeless with only the clothes on their backs and what they could quickly fit into their cars. Sometimes, Wildfires move so quickly and aggressively that pets are left behind. 

Unfortunately, many people are far too familiar with these tragic situations and some have experienced them firsthand.  But people who don’t live in Wildfire-prone areas are not aware of the effect wildfires have on their health and the world. 
The truth is, the large amounts of poisonous smoke emitted by Wildfires affect everyone around the world. The smoke contaminates the air we breathe and disrupts global weather patterns which lead to larger and stronger hurricanes, more floods, stronger tornadoes and hotter temperatures.

This is smoke from wildfires burning in western states traveling across the US to the eastern states and up to Greenland:
Year after year, Wildfires consistently get larger and more intense. Wildfires are happening in places that they have never happened before. If we don't find a way to prevent them from destroying our livelihoods, the end of the world could literally be, ""by fire""!   

Our brave firefighters do a great job with the equipment they have available. But it's obviously not enough!

At H2Osaze, we have the solution to this world-wide problem. 

The solution is our TTF-13 Wildfire Suppression System. 
Guaranteed to prevent the loss and destruction caused by Wildfires and keep our firefighters SAFE!

We've spent 10 years and thousands of dollars on research and development of our system. Read more on the system and the testing on our website  www.h2osaze.com 

The TTF-13 does the job of 30 firefighters, if they were 10 ft. tall.

Because of patent and trademark limitations, we can’t show the actual system but we can give a few technical details.

The system stands over 30 ft. tall and dispenses thousands of gallons of water per minute, covering an area the size of 2 football fields. The system comes in several different models to fit almost any protection zone. The system will protect whole communities, neighborhoods, vineyards, farms, malls, churches and sections of the power grid. 

BUT  NOW  WE NEED  YOUR  HELP!
We need your help in the form of donations to continue our mission. We’ve tried the Venture Capitalist/investor route many times but the deal structures were too finance based instead of mission based. PLEASE, NO SHARKS!

THE BENEFIT
We’re asking the people of the world to help us bring this world-saving system into reality. The benefit of our system for each of you is a viable planet now and for future generations. Not to mention, there will be thousands of Green Jobs created as a result of our system being installed in the U.S. and many places around the world.

While we can’t offer you an immediate reward for your donations, know that your contributions are REALLY going toward the preservation of the planet which is a HUGE reward.  Just a reminder, the wildfires in California last year caused $180 BILLION in damages! Wildfire are serious!....and our system can really mitigate the destruction.

We encourage you to do some research before you donate if only to become more aware of the danger.

Although we’re only asking for whatever money you can spare, we know that TRUST has become an issue with crowd-funding sites. We believe in being transparent by giving our website link, contact information, and pictures of some of our team members. We will also give weekly updates on the progress and the itemization of your donations. The video shows the breakdown of your donations. Please feel free to contact us at any time.

The world thanks you in advance for your contribution, it means the ""world"" to us! We like our Earth... ;)

I am Amaya Bauch and I left my hometown of Paradise CA  over 13 years ago to start my own new life in GA.  I sat helplessly over 2,000 miles away on that nightmarish morning, watching my hometown burn to the ground on TV.  I watched, all the while not knowing if all of my family had survived. The cellphone towers burned early on in the day, leaving us with no communication with our loved ones until after they were evacuated out of Paradise. It was the longest 10 hours of my life! 

The Camp Fire’s devastation has been staggering, it is the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history with the death toll at 88– more than the combined total of the three previous deadliest fires in the state’s history. The total is likely to rise, too, with hundreds of people still reported to be missing throughout Paradise. My hometown of 27,000 people was erased by the flames in a single afternoon. Paradise is simply gone, leaving not only my sister's family homeless, but also my parents, grandmother, and many other family members consisting of aunts, uncles, and cousins.  

But in the wake of this horrific tragedy, my family has found comfort in the blessing that we are all alive and safe and looking forward. 
So it is the privilege for my husband Jay, my son Wyatt and myself to open our home here in Roswell GA to the Lindstrom family on December 21 st as they try to make a new start. This family is my heart. They are my blood. It is my sister, Camellia, My brother-in-law, Sean, My niece Leah (9) and nephew Shea (12).   They have survived this tragic experience, and now are coming across the US to make a new life.

Here in Georgia, we can't smell the smoke that choked their lungs and stung their eyes.  We can't replace all of the loss this family has endured. We can, however, help them rebuild their lives with love, support and the southern hospitality that makes GA legendary. 

 We are HUMBLY seeking monetary donations for their relocation expense, basic clothing, funds to get established in GA and (most urgently) food. Please help them transition to their new lives here with as little stress as possible. 

 Please share this Go Fund Me Campain with all your friends and family, every little bit helps!

From the deepest parts of my heart, thank you for your kindness, prayers, and donations.  Helping this family as they make the pilgrimage from the ashes of Paradise to our open arms here in Roswell, Georgia.

Within 10 minutes, they left the house in their PJs and drove away past many houses and roads on fire. And soon after they found out their house was burnt down to ashes in the most destructive wildfire in California history, the Tubbs Fire. 

The destruction has been massive: 36,807 acres (149 km2) burnt; 5,643 building and structures were destroyed with their home city of Santa Rosa being affected the most. And 20+ fatalities. 

Like many in the Santa Rosa area, Saman and Greg are winemakers and their whole community, neighborhood and places of work have been affected by this disaster. But everyone is coming together to help rebuild so they have a great community of support. But with the scale of the rebuild necessary there is a massive shortage in available consultants, contractors, builders. Insurance companies and the local government have been involved but also overwhelmed with the magnitude. 

Saman & Greg are extremely strong and not the kind who would ever ask for help (those of you who know them personally, know exactly what I am talking about). But a year after the fire and it is more than clear to me that they can use our help in any way to continue the painful process of reconstructing their lives. They are still renting in the area and the reconstruction of their house has not yet started. 

Many of you have already reached out and helped out in so many ways during this past year and we are all deeply thankful to you. This campaign is for anyone who is looking for an outlet to contribute to their rebuilding efforts and pulling their lives back to some normalcy. 

Other ways to help:

- if you know of any contractors, builders, etc. that are available/willing to work up there, do reach out and let us know so we can put you in touch with those in need. 

- buy Sonoma wines and visit Sonoma wineries and businesses. they need our help more than ever in keeping their businesses and communities.

130 homes burned and an existing 44 still stand uninhabitable.
While the insurance companies and fema paid off all the homeowners dwellings that burned up, they have done nothing for us but leave our abandoned  homes to looters.
Fema has not gave us compensation, nor  the insurance companies.
Our home, our lives our future all depend on the owner who says he will not rebuild and that we will never live in our homes again!
And he hasn't offered to buy us out !
This is where we stand , my 71yr old mother our 3 little dogs and 3 goldfish living at the hotel across the street from the park for 7 months now. 
fema quit paying months ago. Thankfully, A local charity has been helping to pay for our hotel and i pay too from my own savings account which has been dwindling away.
Very soon, we will not have the help for hotels nor be able to pay from our savings and will end up on the streets of Santa rosa, God I pray not!
With that being said, I have decided to relocate my family to Washington where I have my son and my grandchildren.
There are a lot more housing opportunities  available to us there.  
Sonoma county has 10,000 families competing for any housing that comes on the market.
With no help from any government , county, or donated funds for fire survivor.

On the evening on Monday, December 3, the Thomas Fire engulfed the hills north of Santa Paula before continuing its wrath toward the neighboring city of Ventura. Along its path of utter destruction, the fire consumed Wheeler Canyon Mobile Home Park, once home to many students and families of our rural school district. 

The families of our beloved district have become extended family. Over the years, they have shown their support in all ways possible from the academics: partnerships, volunteering, fundraising, and rushing from a long day’s work to participate in evening college readiness programs; to the personal: noticing your favorites, remembering your baby’s birthday, stopping to chat about family while running weekend errands, and sending you homemade meals to thank you for the time their child forgot their lunch and you quickly gave yours away. 

Today, it is our turn to show these families our love and support. The outpouring of compassion for all those affected by the Thomas Fire has been overwhelming. Donations to this campaign will help pay for essentials, medical and personal expenses, other necessities, and hopefully bring some much needed holiday cheer.

Given that this campaign has been established for the 11 families (please see update) of Wheeler Canyon Mobile Home Park, on behalf of the beneficiaries, I will be responsible for withdrawing the funds. All funds will then be distributed directly and equally among the 11 families (please see update) affected. Your contribution will be received with heartfelt appreciation for your support comes at a time when all our families have is one another.

                        Poetry Chapbook",https://www.gofundme.com/chapbook,Poetry Chapbook,"I've written a series of poems about the 2008 California wildfires, drought, love, and anxiety about the future called Northern California Lightning Series. I'd like to self-publish these poems as a chapbook.

What's a chapbook?
A chapbook is a small collection of poetry that often centers on a specific theme and is published in small runs.

Why self-publish?
I'm trying to get my poems into people's hands with the least barriers possible. I'm going down more traditional submission routes with other poems, but this series works best as a group. The prestige of a publisher accepting my work is less important to me than you reading it.

Where will the money go?

Printing
I found a great designer/printer who will work with me to create a customized chapbook. Books will be hand-sewn and I promise they'll look really nice. I'm aiming for a run of 100. Extra money will go towards a larger run.

Shipping
Some money will be going towards shipping the books to donors or other people who should have them.

E-book
I will be releasing the book in some kind of electronic format and would like to pay one of my talented programmer friends for their work.

Are there donation rewards?
Donations of any amount (the gofundme minimum is $5) will receive a signed copy of the Northern Califonia Lightning Series.

Why make a printed book at all?
There's something very important about physical objects, about reading from a page, about these talismans we can carry with us.

Will the books cost money?
No, I will not be charging for the chapbooks. The goal is for people to read my poems, not to make any profit.

Sample poem from the chapbook:

Afternoon at the Russian River

The bathing suit I’d borrowed didn’t fit.
Wet polyester crawled into the fold
under my breasts, too tight and too loose
at once. Slick river rocks slid beneath my feet
and the barbeque burned.
Watched you talking on the shore.
Hated you some for bringing me
like an offering out
into the loud sun, loud talk
of strangers. Swam upstream
to spite you, leave you
wondering where I’d gone.
Drought made the current mellow.
I floated back down on the surface,
belly up, arms open,
ears underwater.",770,400,21,21,8,,,https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/4229572_1429325371.0813.jpg,21,8,21,0.9904,2167,400,1.925,1,0,"['urban area', 'suburb', 'residential area', 'urban design', 'neighbourhood', 'metropolitan area', 'city', 'metropolis']"

Over the last few days, it has been just amazing to hear how much my Dad meant to some of you. Many of you refer to him as your own Dad. He’s just the type of person that pulls you in and makes you feel like you’re at home and loved. 



For those of you who don’t know, my sweet 81 year old Dad just lost his home and everything he owns in the recent northern California wild fire. We’re so thankful he was able to get safely out of the fire, even though it was only with the clothes on his back. In the end, he is all that matters. In the midst of losing our childhood home and entire town of Paradise that we loved and grew up in, we are so grateful to still have him. 



We have no idea what the coming months will bring. My dad is recovering from a recent heart surgery last month and now he is moving into our one bedroom condo with nothing but a few pairs of clothes. We’re more than happy to share this space, any way we need to, but it will take a lot of resources to get my Dad back on his feet. 



The money you donate, will go directly to his needs only. Whether it’s to help put new shoes on his feet, to getting him comfortable and self sufficient again in a new place. We will also be transporting him between Washington and California for potential surgery follow ups, doctors appointments, and to salvage anything we can from his property once they open the roads back up. Anything you help donate will greatly help us take care of all of his needs over the next coming months.

Family and friends, 
Joanne here from New York calling on all my friends and family!
Due to the catastrophic wildfires in Northern California, (Sonoma, CA) my family (Sabrina (neice), Scott (nephew-in-law), Anne (sister) and Tom (brother-in-law)) have been urgently evacuated from their homes this week and will be evacuated again.  With no time to pack or gather belongings and resources for sustenance, and no indication of when or what they will return to, immediate future, or even work - I have set up this fund for assistance.
They are currently in their camper (4 adults/2 dogs+cat) at a campground in Santa Rosa soon to be evacuated again.

Any small contribution you can donate that will be used for the following to keep them afloat for few weeks will be immensely necessary and appreciated: 
-Water
-Food
-Clothes and shoes
-Blankets and sheets
-Medications
-Propane, Fuel
-Batteries for headlamps and air bed pump
-Laundry money and soap
-Paper towels, plates, bowls, cutlery, toilet paper 
-Masks/Air purifier

Their pride speaks strength, but their distraught voices speak uncertainty, distress and hardship.

Parker is Luke's twin brother; Kendall is Parker's fiancée, and Evie is their sweet little 2-month-old baby girl.

While Parker and Kendall were born and raised on opposite sides of the country – Parker in South Georgia and Kendall in Paradise, California – God has a way of bringing together those who were meant to be, and that’s exactly what He did. Parker joined the Army back in 2010 and served 4 years. It was during his time as a soldier that he met Kendall while stationed in Texas. Once Parker’s period of service had come to an end, he returned to Georgia and Kendall to California. However, it didn’t take long for them to decide they wanted to spend their daily life together, and they decided to start that life together in Kendall’s hometown of Paradise, California.

2018 was proving to be the best year of their lives – they found out they were expecting a sweet little baby, bought their first family home together, and then welcomed the most beautiful little blessing, Eva Rose White, on September 18, 2018. Their hearts were full, and then tragedy struck.

I feel it is safe to assume that most everyone has at least heard a little on the news about the wildfires ravaging California right now – the Woolsey fire in Southern California and the Camp Fire in Northern California. The Camp Fire has proved itself to be the most destructive wildfire in California’s recorded history, and, unfortunately, the deadliest as well. The Camp Fire has essentially destroyed Paradise, California along with surrounding communities such as Magalia and Concow. The home that Parker & Kendall bought earlier this year was in Magalia, and all of Kendall’s family’s homes were in Paradise.

As a result of the Camp Fire, Parker, Kendall, & baby Evie lost their home along with their possessions. The evacuation came so quickly that they were forced to leave with very little.  The same is true for Kendall’s family as well – parents, grandparents, sister, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins – everyone. Not only did they all lose their homes and possessions, but most of them worked in the Paradise area as well and no longer have jobs either.

The long road ahead is paved with many challenges for them all and they will need the kindness, generosity, and support of others to help them get through. This $10,000 goal will be just the start to the relief they need, but I pray that we can make things a little easier for Parker & Kendall, along with Kendall’s family. They will obviously have to replace their homes and possessions, but there will also be trials in the meantime. They will need places to stay, food to eat, clothing, daily essentials for themselves & their pets, and help with any regular bills they may still have.

Events like this are purely tragic, but it’s also through events like this that we can be reminded to be grateful for what we have and to be willing to help others in whatever way we can. No donation is too small, and I can assure you that each and every donation will be so greatly appreciated. Let’s rally behind Parker, Kendall, baby Evie, and all of Kendall’s family during this hard time by offering our support, donations, and prayers.

The company I work for is graciously allowing me to take a week of vacation time (with very short notice) to serve in this capacity.  I'll be sleeping on a local church floor each night.   From last year's experience in Austin, TX (Hurricane Harvey relief), I anticipate that the working conditions will be rough, but the food will be good and plentiful.  My fellow volunteers will be of unmatched character, and are coming from places all across the country.  To the best of my knowledge, I don't personally know anyone there yet, but I expect to leave at the end of next week with lifelong friends.



Travel expenses from Maine to California are proving to be a challenge and I can use some help.  This is probably due to the immediacy of the timing.  I will be traveling as cheaply as possible given the time constraints.  Will you please consider coming alongside me in supporting the victims of this massive fire by contributing towards this compassionate ministry relief trip?  I'll be your personal representative!  Any financial contribution will be greatly appreciated, and I'll be forever indebted for your prayers.

Ojai is my heart and has been my home for five years now. This place has brought so much magic and love into my life. Sadly, however, on December 4th the Thomas fire broke out in upper Ojai quickly making its way to the East end where my boyfriend and I lived with our two dogs. We evacuated on Monday night heading up the 101 North to Carpinteria for a night and then up to Santa Barbara for two nights with the fire hopping the freeway and making it's way into Carpinteria and then soon making its way into Montecito county. We continued to move further up North. Once again, we packaged up the dogs and headed North to Buelton for two days, then up to Pismo for three days. Upon driving back to Ojai on the evening of December 12, we learned that due to severe smoke damage, our little trailer that we called home was uninhabitable. We were forced to relocate and throw away almost all our belongings. Unfortunately, being on the run for eight days already, I used up almost all of my financial resources, and as of December 15th I was fired from my job due to the business changing their amount of hours they will be open. With the Thomas fire having burned 267,500 acres so far and only 40 percent contained, quickly making it's way to number three on the list of California's worst wildfires in history. There seems to be no end. My heart is broken. My body and mind are exhausted, as well as my poor animals who I keep having to move from place to place.
All this to say, I am reaching out for help to relocate my family and to replace some of our belongings. If you feel the inspiration to donate, any amount would be greatly appreciated.

                        Eagle Scout Project for the SPCA",https://www.gofundme.com/j37eue24,Eagle Scout Project for the SPCA,"Hello Everybody,

My name is Darian Douraghy and I am a Boy Scout of Troop 42 in San Mateo. Currently, I am working on achieving scouting's highest rank, the rank of Eagle Scout. Over the course of many years, I have studied survival techniques, developed leadership and coordinating skills, and refined my ability to teach the material I have learned to others. Now, after completing dozens of requirements and hundreds of hours of commitment, I am eligible to begin my final task to attain the rank of Eagle Scout. In order to do this, I must plan and lead a project that both benefits my community and demonstrates my leadership capabilities. 

For this endeavor, I am putting my efforts towards the SPCA. I chose the SPCA for several reasons. First, they have been a known and longstanding benefit to the community. By taking in thousands of animals each year, they both keep our society safer and improve the welfare of many animals (and people) that would otherwise get no help or treatment. Second, I personally have a passion for animals, having owned various pets such as dogs, cats, and fish. Third, they not only help dogs and cats, but they even have a great ecological benefit by providing treatment and relocation for wildlife. An example of this is that SPCA volunteers have been working to assist in animal rescue for the recent California Wildfires. Fourth, which most pertains to my project, they take in animals that are considered to be domestic farm animals. In the bay area, there are many regulations that do not allow farm animals to be kept as pets or in city boundaries. These animals also can not be released into the wild, nor can they be adopted by most people in or around the bay area for the aforementioned reasons (chickens are a great example, furthermore I will be lending my efforts to them through this project). Legal restrictions and regulations make it very difficult to adopt out these farm animals to our locals, very few people have the correct certification. This means that the SPCA may have to keep the farm animals for quite some time. Just like humans, animals might be complacent with small and simple living quarters for a day or two, but anything longer could be considered close to torture. Without proper space and resources to exhibit natural behavioral outlets, the animals will likely develop behavioral issues and ultimately be unhappy, if not in distress. 

Chickens, in particular, live in a very structured and hierarchical society. In nature, the jungle fowl (the species which chickens originated from) has a population that is fairly stable, as few individuals enter and leave the flock. At the SPCA, usually only a few get received and adopted at a time, so population dynamics are constantly shifting. This perpetual adjustment means that dominance must constantly be reassessed, reinforced, and restructured. The term “pecking order” literally comes from chickens who, at worst, may kill each other (by pecking) during this unending struggle. Even if they don’t mortally wound each other, the group will live in constant fear of one another. One might propose housing them separately, but that would lead to just as many issues, as they would turn to self-mutilation to relieve the stress (the self inflicted injuries allow for the release of cortisol, which wanes their stress levels). The only real solution is proper housing with proper resources and outlets for them to exercise all the behaviors they feel they must engage in. 

I plan on helping to construct a new environment for the avian facility at the SPCA. Many of these birds are far from finding a new home. Creating a new and improved environment for them would allow them to establish a hierarchy in which they would not have fight each other nearly as often and could live more naturally and comfortably. 

I will be using the money that is garnered for this project to fund the expenses for the necessary materials. If extra money is left over upon completion of the project, it will all be donated to the Burlingame SPCA or the project will be expanded or improved beyond initial expectations. Thank you all for taking the time to read this. All donations of any size are whole-heatedly appreciated.

Best Regards,
Darian Douraghy",500,500,9,9,45,,,https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/6439266_1445634483.6818.jpg,9,45,9,0.9935,4265,500,1.0,1,0,"['chicken', 'galliformes', 'beak', 'rooster', 'poultry', 'livestock', 'bird']"

The recent wildfires have burned the town beyond recognition.

On the 13th of September - my grandson's 7th birthday - the wildfire took over their home and farm. Augustus spent most of his birthday on the floor of the family car, squished up with his little brother - 4 year-old Hudson - and the family dog, Violet. Their daddy drove and remained calm while he wound down Cobb Mountain to find his wife, my daughter, Kristen Rachel Callahan. She had gone to work that morning not realizing that life as they knew it would dramatically changed.

The fire destroyed their rental property, the farm, and all of their personal possessions. All of their tools and equipment is burned to ashes, including their work truck. They have only the clothes their dad stuffed in the car and whatever they were wearing.

I am reaching out to friends and family for help. Any amount of money you can give will provide them with the creature comforts and personal items they need for their children including food, toiletry items, household items, and more.  They also need to find another home and they need gas for their car.

The Camp Fire in Butte County of northern Cali is now the deadliest in California history with 57 dead and over 300 missing as of Wednesday night– and one of the most destructive, with over 8,000 homes utterly decimated and nearly 140,000 acres burned. The fires are still going.


I am donating $1 for every mile I ride this week at Cyclebar-Berkeley to California Wildfire Relief efforts through the Red Cross– and I am inviting you to MATCH my donation, and/or give ANY amount you can. 


I have found an incredibly generous anonymous donor who is going to MATCH whatever we raise (up to $1000) to further multiply our efforts! That means your contribution will be DOUBLED. 


Sometimes it feels like we can’t make a difference if we can only give a small amount, but every single contribution helps. There are nearly 330 million people in the U.S., and if every person gave just $1 – well, you can do the math. :) Any amount you can give brings people that much closer to recovering, and relieves that much burden on those affected.
 

I’ll be posting my mileage here and on Instagram (@lizzard_hm). Follow along for updates! The match challenge will go from Sunday 11/11 to Sunday 11/18, but I’m going to leave donations open until Wednesday 11/21. I’ll add my donations on this coming Sunday! 


I am so so appreciative of all the people who have already pledged to match me – you are amazing, and I am touched by your generosity. Please share and spread awareness. There are a lot of great fundraising opportunities out there, and they are all helpful. Please consider giving through here so we can DOUBLE your impact from our donor match.  

 

As a note, I want the money we raise to go specifically to California wildfire relief efforts via the Red Cross, and since there is not that specific option through GoFundMe, I have set this up as a personal fundraiser.


It’s also all on my Instagram page (@lizzard_hm) in the highlights and my story. Please message me with questions! I’ll do my best to respond ASAP, but please know I am on a tight deadline to finish my dissertation so I am a little swamped! 

 

California! We are a FAMILY! 

I ride for you, and we ride as one. Through everything.


As a note, I chose the Red Cross because it donates approximately 0.91 cents on the dollar for disaster relief, and it has the organization and infrastructure to provide help on a massive scale - which is what this disaster calls for.

The target fundraising amount is $20,000.
 
This will greatly help them purchase new furniture, clothes, pet supplies and other items needed for daily living, fix their car, as well identify and move into a new home. 
 
A bit of backstory on Nicole and Lete. They celebrated their engagement on October 27, 2018, with plans to marry in 2019. Their engagement rings were lost in the fire. Both being northern CA long-time residents, they moved from Chico to Paradise to start their new journey together. They rented a 3-bedroom house in Paradise, off of Clark Road. Nicole recently graduated with her degree in Sociology with plans to start her career in the nonprofit sector supporting underprivileged and marginalized communities. Lete has worked as a California Fire Fighter for over a decade. She played a significant role in fighting the fires in northern CA over this past year, with 45 days on the recent Carr Fire. During this time period, she worked around the clock, spending many days and nights away from home. Both Lete and Nicole recognized this was a time to sacrifice and pull together with their community to support the people and environment of northern CA. 
 
They had only been living in Paradise for 4 months when the recent Camp Fire hit. On Thursday, November 8th, at 8 am, Lete, being on her last day of leave from work, woke-up to her phone ringing. Once she opened her eyes, she noticed the sky was dark red. She ran to the front door and was met with heavy smoke and approaching flames. She immediately woke Nicole and they both moved as quickly as possible to save themselves, their pets and alert their neighbors, many of whom were still asleep. Lete lit a backfire behind their homes in an attempt to save lives and property. Nicole gathered their 3 dogs and 1 cat and packed as many belongings as she could in the car. About 1 hour after spotting the fire, they were in the car heading out of Paradise joining their neighbors in the heavy flow of traffic. It took them 1 hour to make it a single block from their home, and 3 hours to make it safely to Chico. The small two-lane road was clogged with 5 lanes of outbound traffic, with people driving on the sidewalks, or abandoning their cars altogether to go on foot.  

Many were affected by the CA fires and need support. I am asking for your support for Nicole and Lete, who I know with our support will be stronger and in a better position to help others in their community. Lete will soon return to work to continue the fight against the raging California wildfires, and Nicole is in the process of making care packages for other victims and gathering resources to take to shelters throughout the area. Though they had just moved into Paradise, they quickly became a part of the community, where they knew some old friends and met many new wonderful people. Nicole was in training to become a volunteer at the local animal shelter and Lete helped out around the neighborhood with such things as helping their neighbor patch their roof in preparation for the winter weather. In fact, the night before the fire, Nicole and Lete gathered with friends helping to paint chairs for an upcoming charity Art Auction benefiting the local animal shelter, not realizing the next day their friends and themselves would be homeless. 

Though the community is now spread out at different shelters and homes of friends and family, they are still a community. I know with confidence both Lete and Nicole will continue to be a part of the Paradise community and support all members as they move toward healing and rebuilding.

Thank you for your support. It will have a direct and positive impact for many. 
 

Peace,

 Maria

We are looking for Fundraising Supporters to help support our Wildfires Fastpitch Family.  Thank you for any donation.   You will help make the difference.

Wildfires began way back in October 23, 2013 by three Servants of God with a burning desire for God and softball.  Jesus placed an idea onto these men’s heart of what softball would be like if God was First, family second and softball last.  It’s people like you in our  that make the difference.  Perhaps if you have time we would love for you to visit one of our games.  

Quick Look

Wildfires is a Faith Based Fastpitch Non-Profit Orginzation that brings compeditive softball to the Ripon area with out sacraficing Church and Family.  We are looking to add a web site next month, buy some much need equipment and help fund some of our players.   Please read below for an expanded look.

Our Goals

We may not reach our goal but any donation will help. We have expanded from one team to two teams this year. Next year we plan on expanding even more. The fact is Fastpitch just cost lots of money.  Just to play it costs each team $11,920 and some change. We are asking for donations to help fund our explantion. We would like to set up a web site that comes with an app that would greatly help with parent communication and in involvement. It costs approx $560 to start and $530 a year to maintain. We are looking to buy new equipment and catchers gear. Total cost for two teams $2400. The start up of a new team is $1200. We Tithe 10% on everything we get. This puts us in the RED but God has always provided a way. We have Girls on our team that get paid through donations. But those donations have not all came through yet. It's God's timing. Your donation will make a dirrect impact on young players lives.  Please consider donating.  Help Build Lives through sports!

The Wildfire Difference...

Wildfires is a unique softball family focusing mainly on player development and a balance between tournaments and family life. We feel that at this age, God and family come first...then softball. Most of our families don’t like the idea of playing tournaments that take up their entire weekend (including Sundays) every week. They want to give their child the competitive experience of tournament softball, but also want to be able to give equal time to their other children. They want their child to be able to improve on their skills, and they don’t want to have to spend extra money in addition to their team fees to make that happen.  We encourage our players to give back to their school sports programs.  And finally, they want coaches who care about their children, who have positive attitudes, and who expect the same from their players, families and themselves. 


It is my hope that if you give. Give from the heart. Thank you Friends.",1000,27384,1,1,25,,,https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/6842909_1447221140.7342.jpg,1,25,1,0.998,2819,27384,0.036517675,0,0,"['team', 'team sport', 'social group', 'community', 'youth', 'race', 'sports', 'recreation', 'competition event', 'fun']"

The fires have taken a lot from our northern county community and we are just starting to rebuild, we hope to make rebuilding The Crystal Ship a healing part of that process.

Our brothers and sisters from the Abraxas Art Car have donated their old bus to us and we have concept art for the new ship. Now we need to fund the build, the previous incarnation of the Crystal Ship was funded entirely by myself and fellow camp mates. The scope of the build and financial stress of the fires has made that option unattainable.

The growing devastation of wildfires in California have destroyed and evacuated homes and workplaces, created hazardous air quality conditions, closed schools, severed freeways, and led to economic impacts such as housing shortages, wage and job losses, evacuation and childcare expenses and other costs for many across the region.

Many care for our children and elderly parents; clean our homes and hotel rooms; cook and serve our restaurant meals; maintain our lawns and landscaping; and tend to and harvest the fruits and vegetables that are the backbone of our regional economy.

The 805 Undocufund was created in the aftermath of the 2017 Thomas Fire, then the largest wildfire in California history, and reopened after the Hill and Woolsey Fires in 2018.

We frequently watch natural disasters allover the world on various different news stations and still manage to maintain our elitist New Yorker attitude. Most of us sit there and say “it wasn’t as bad as Sandy” or even more, “it’s not that bad”. Aakash and Asher, having been born and raised in New Jersey are unfortunately no exception to this commonality. Having traveled over 2,500 miles to begin our academic careers at UCLA we found ourselves as outsiders looking in. Little did we know our lives were about to change forever. Some of you may know why some of you may not. Regardless, you are about to learn. This past week, the two of us, and the entire state of California as a whole, were forced to band together and surmount one of the greatest challenges we have ever had to face; the Skirball fire. A fire that burned 400+ acres was no longer something we only saw in newspapers or perhaps on television, it was real life. We will never forget the feeling of walking out of Powell library and just being absolutely bombarded by a massive cloud of smoke that encompassed the perimeter of campus, in addition to the ashe that quickly built up on our shoes and clothes. Having had to experience the extreme difficulty associated with breathing in these conditions, I can’t even begin to imagine what it must have felt like to actually live in the heart of the fire, and that is the main reason for the creation of this very page. Having first hand had to live through this California wildfire we know exactly what it feels like to feel helpless, alone, and overwhelmed by the harsh realities that Californians are forced to deal with. In the past month over 200,000 acres of land have burned with almost 100,000 people forced to evacuate. We want to raise money for 3  groups: Red Cross, LA County Animal Care Foundation, and the Salvation army. A third of the total donations will go to each of the charities. The Red Cross is running many of the evacuation centers and the donations will go towards first responders and the evacuation efforts. The Animal Care foundation donations will be for housing of the many displaced cats, dogs, and horses and to train first responders to rescue these poor animals.

The recent Northern California wildfires have brought devastation to so many. The fires have destroyed more than 220,000 acres, and 5,700 homes and businesses. As a result, more than 90,000 people have been displaced.

Coffey Park, a square mile of homes on the northern edge of Santa Rosa, was among the hardest hit areas from the series of wildfires that broke out October 8th; an area described by many as ""Ground Zero.""

Among the Coffey Park residents was one of Clark Pest Controls' own, Eddie Rangel, a 12-year employee and devoted Commercial Service Technician. Sadly, Eddie and his family lost their home in the deadly fires that ravaged through Santa Rosa. Eddie, his wife Kathy, and their two young daughters, ages 4 and 5, have lost everything and need help to rebuild their lives and return a sense of normalcy to their two young daughters.

If you’re able, please donate to the Eddie Rangel Fire Relief fund to help Eddie and his family rebuild their lives. On behalf of Eddie and his family, Clark Pest Control sends their appreciation for your prayers, incredible support and kindness.

On the morning of November 8, a phone call woke her, telling her to GET OUT NOW! It was so dark that she thought it must be before dawn, but when she got outside, she could see that a fast-moving wildfire was already at the far end of her street, and the sky was dark with smoke. Here's the picture she took down the road as she fled:


She was lucky enough to escape, with the parrots, through jammed-up traffic, and find the last available room at a motel in nearby Chico. Now, she'll need help to fund a search for a suitable long-term home. She is disabled and on a fixed income, and lived in the most inexpensive rented place in the area, but California is an expensive place to live!

The town of Paradise was over 90% destroyed by the Camp Fire, which is, as of November 14, the most destructive and deadly wildfire in California history. More than 9,700 single-family homes are known to have been destroyed so far, and 71 people are known dead. (Here's a Sacramento Bee article about the evacuees of the fire, and here's Sally's own article about her experience.)

Most of the 27,000 former residents of the town of Paradise are also looking for housing, and high rents in this area will go higher still. Sally will need financial assistance to keep herself and her birds going while she searches for a new place to live, which may take some time. To explore some options, she will need to pay for overnight travel, and when she finds a place to rent, she will need at least the first month's rent plus security deposit. And although she carried renter's insurance, she has lost literally everything except the contents of her laundry basket, and the insurance payout is likely to fall short of replacing all that she needs. The proceeds of this campaign will go directly to Sally, who has been designated the sole recipient of these funds.

I'm editing this story to assuage the concerns of GoFundMe that there must be something shady going on here because we've raised so much money so quickly without apparent reference to Facebook or Twitter (although I'm sure some of our donors are also sharing).

My name is Susan Williams. and I am proud to be a registered user of Daily Kos. I know my friend Sally, the subject of this campaign, even though I live in New Jersey and she lives in California, because we are both part of the extraordinary online community there. The reason this campaign has been so very active is that, when we post on Daily Kos that a member of our community is in trouble, people turn out.

Recently one of his sisters was going thru some transition in her life and Juan took her in about 1 month ago so she could have a fresh start. They had to flee for their lives at a moments notice from the fast moving wildfire thru flame lined streets with embers flying all around and the day turned black as night with the smoke from the fires in a heartbeat. They were blessed to barely escape with their lives. The mobile home park where they lived was ""completely destroyed"" according to reports from Butte county officials along with all their possessions. Juan makes his living doing construction and all his tools were in their home. Imagine starting fresh in life, no money, no possessions, no home to call your own. Juan Gonzales is the most compassionate man I have ever known, now hopefully his karma from the compassion he has always shown others will carry him thru to the next chapter of his life, and his sister's life too.  I have over 1000 friends on Facebook and I figure if all of them could spare $20 each, this goal is easily reachable.  Think of what is would cost to have first, last, and security deposits, new clothing & tools so you could work, not to mention food and a refrigerator to put it in for 2 people and this seems like a conservative estimate to me. Any help you could provide so that Juan and his sister can have a fresh start is greatly appreciated.

I am a member of the American Red Cross. I am hereby pleading for Good Samaritans  to come to the aid of the displaced citizens affected by the wildfire in California. 

All donations to this fund will support recovery and relief efforts for Californians affected by wildfires. Initially, the fund will help first responders meet immediate needs for food, fuel, clean water, hygiene products, and shelter. Once initial relief work is complete, this fund will transition to support longer-term recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations responding to these fires.

In November 2018, strong winds caused another round of large, destructive fires to erupt across the state of California. This new batch of wildfires includes the Woolsey Fire and the Camp Fire, the latter of which killed at least 85 people and almost 150 still unaccounted for. It destroyed more than 18,000 structures, becoming both California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire on record.

California is suffering the deadliest wildfire in state history, with more than 50 people dead and hundreds more missing. The wildfire, known as the Camp Fire, has scorched 135,000 acres in Northern California’s Butte County, while a separate fire in the southern part of the state has burned Ventura and Los Angeles counties. President Donald Trump approved disaster aid for the state, where more than 7,000 structures have burned and another 15,000 are at risk. The fire was 35% contained as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Americans are rushing to donate supplies, food and clothes to help victims. But organizations including the American Red Cross and the Humane Society say victims need cash more than anything else. “We all want to help the victims of the #CampFire, but please don’t send supplies, as the evacuation centers say they have been inundated,” Darrell Steinberg, mayor of Sacramento, tweeted. (Sacramento is 90 miles away from the fires.)

“After a disaster hits, the American Red Cross witnesses the incredible generosity of people from across the country who want to help in any way they can with donations of items like clothes, shoes, food and household items, but the reality is, cash donations are best,” the Red Cross said in a statement.

In Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire has ravaged communities, the Humane Society of Ventura County said it was stocked with supplies, but will need more money for items like pet food. Actress Sandra Bullock donated $100,000 to HSVC, which is caring for cats, dogs, donkeys, pigs, horses, chickens, ducks and other pets displaced by the fire. (The organization will care for these animals until the owners can reunite with them, it said.)

Want to join me in making a difference? I'm raising money for American Red Cross, and any donation will help make impact. Thanks in advance for your contribution to this cause that means so much to me.

Many of my friends and family have been displaced, losing everything. My dad left with only his car, the ashes of his beloved pet that he lost only months before, and the clothes on his back. Our family is fortunate though in the fact that they all made it out alive!

Now, as the ash begins to settle, the reality of starting over is starting to set in. Many zones have yet to be opened in the devastated areas, and will continue to remain closed while the search for human remains continues. This includes the zone that my dad once called home. The funding that was helping provide temporary shelter is beginning to wain, and the cost of starting over is beginning to look overwhelming. After facing multiple health issues, my dad has lived on a fixed income for years. As you can imagine, this does not allow for much when considering the expenses he is now facing.

I can only ask in this season of giving, that if anybody has a few spare dollars, they consider helping. It could be as little as the cost of your morning coffee, every little bit helps! If unable to help by donating, perhaps you can help by sharing the request. Anything done is greatly appreciated!

These devastating fires have left families, schools, and child care providers without the basic necessities they need to care for our youngest children. Considerable resources will be needed to rebuild the services upon which families rely.

To that end, we have established a relief fund to support First 5 counties in their rebuilding efforts. In the coming weeks and months, these funds will be directed (100%) to counties for recovery services such as: mental health supports for evacuated families, supplies for damaged family child care homes and preschool, additional family programs to support children affected by the fires, and temporary child care supports.  All donations to this specific fund will be used by First 5s in their communities for recovery efforts focusing on the needs of children 0-5 and their families. 

First 5 works in every county to improve the lives of children ages zero to five. Deeply connected to our communities, First 5s are well positioned to address the needs associated with rebuilding support for young children and families. The services we support include: family resource centers, parent education classes, home visits for newborns, and family child care homes and preschools.

Hello, my name is Lael Edmonds, and I am a childhood friend of Evie's, from her hometown of Richmond, Virginia.  Joy, AKA Liz, asked me to help them by posting this gofundme for them.  The funds will go to Joy to assist with relocation from California to Richmond, and setting up a new household, and purchasing replacement medical equipment for Evie, who is disabled.   Only Joy will be able to withdraw donated funds, not me.  

 Our Story – Joy and Evie Lonnes

Imagine, loud banging wakes you up at 2:30 AM. The winds are gusting outside blowing your outdoor furniture around. You get up and go out your front door to see what's happening. The smoke is so thick you begin coughing. You can barely breath. You cover your face with the neck of your pajamas. You look around and realize that live embers are blowing around, landing on your driveway, your street, your walkway, and then you realize, on your ROOF! Wow! That only means one thing. EVACUATE NOW!

You wake up your partner, your kids, dress quickly, grab the pets, the cell and laptop and go. As you’re driving out you see another house in your neighborhood fully engulfed in flames. You get out with only minutes to spare. Now you are driving but you have no idea where you are going. 

At 3 a.m. on Monday October 9th, Evie and Joy (AKA Liz) Lonnes’ home in Journey’s End mobile home park in Santa Rosa, California burned to the ground.  The Tubbs wildfire had winds gusting at 50 to 60 MPH, spreading live embers with lightning speed.  The fire was jumping and running so fast that people had no time to pack. Everyone in the Porter Canyon area, Fountaingrove Hills area and the Journey's End Park had to literally run for their lives. Evie and Joy were some of the lucky ones who escaped with their lives, and the clothes on their backs.

What our neighborhood looked like after the fire swept through

 Joy is a great grandma of 74 years old. She is caring for her disabled daughter Evie, who is permanently disabled from a hemorrhagic stroke. Evie is both hearing and speech impaired, as well as suffering from right side immobility. 

Evie and Joy (AKA Liz) Lonnes
 
Not only did Joy lose her residence, and a lifetimes’ collection of belongings, but she lost her ability to continue her courier work in Sonoma county, which was provided some income to supplement social security. The cost of living is Sonoma is so high that she cannot afford to stay. 

Evie and Joy in front of their home before the fire

There is practically no housing available in Santa Rosa. There was a serious shortage before the fire, but now, since thousands of people have lost their homes, the pressure on housing is simple unimaginable. In fact, Sonoma county is estimated to have lost 20% of all its residences, and the fires aren't done yet. 

 What Happens Next

 Through heartbreaking loss, Joy has continued maintain a positive attitude, and an ability to keep moving forward.  She finds it necessary to move back to Richmond, where she fortunately has family and friends. Her daughter, Diana, is offering her a place to stay temporarily so she and Evie can transition to a new life.  They are very grateful.

 

How you can help

Joy hopes to raise at least $15,000 to fund the costs of moving and acquiring a whole new set of household furnishings and supplies, clothing and disabled supplies to help Evie with the tasks of daily living. Anything and everything that anyone is moved to contribute, is gratefully accepted and deeply appreciated.

We remember all too clearly how horrific the wildfires were last year.  Now our family, friends, and neighbors find themselves facing a renewed nightmare.

This fundraiser is an opportunity to send some comfort, escape, and love to kids who right now may have lost, or may be losing, everything.

Consider how much your own kids love a bedtime story.  Consider the love, bonding, and comfort that a book creates and a story conjures.

Think about the knowledge and understanding that books can provide about our world, or of the many other worlds that books can take you to; the places you can travel and escape to.

These are all the gifts we can give to a little one whose world has been turned completely upside-down.

Please consider donating and help me give these children an amazing gift.

 
My goal is to raise $1000 worth of Usborne books to send to the children impacted by these fires.  Once we hit $250, Usborne Books and More will match 50% of all donations! 

I am partnering with North Bay Donate, a local nonprofit organization created last year during the October firestorm.  I will deliver the books to North Bay Donate who in turn will distribute them throughout the impacted areas.

During the California wildfires last year in Santa Barbara, Sage fled to the local ice rink, as the highways closed down and the air quality worsened. The rink was like a second home for her, having ice skated there since it opened in 2015, but for dozens of others, it was a temporary refuge from the elements. With ample time to wait out the weather, Sage laced up her skates to enjoy some rink time alongside many others. She ran into her coach, Cedric, who introduced her to a boy about her same age named Sam. Cedric encouraged them to take advantage of this time to try something new - pair skating. As a former professional pair skater, Cedric taught Sage and Sam a few tricks designed for pairs, and within minutes, it was clear to everyone that there was a natural chemistry. When the weather cleared, Sage and Sam left the ice rink on a new mission to become a ice skating pairs team and compete on the national stage.

As the months followed, Sam and Sage trained together with Cedric for 2 hours each day after school. Their abilities rapidly progressed, and through competition, the two quickly advanced up to the Intermediate level of pairs skating. Recently, Sage and Sam finished 1st place at the Golden West Championships, qualifying them for a series of more competitive regional and sectional events in the upcoming weeks.

At this point, Sage and Sam only need one more competition win to qualify for the National Ice Skating Competition for Intermediate Pairs in Detroit, Michigan in January 2019, and we invite you to join Sage and Sam on this exciting journey and support their dream through GoFundMe.

Sage and Sam are chasing a dream, but the unfortunate reality is that ice skating is an expensive sport. Now that they are gearing up for higher levels of competition, their training efforts have doubled (and so have the costs). This means paying more for ice time, coaching lessons, choreography, travel, skates, competition outfits, and testing fees.

To cover some of these extra costs, Sage and Sam spent the summer working and have continued working during the school year where possible. Sage walks and housesits for dogs, and Sam helps out at the ice rink. Sage's mom, Jill has also picked up a second job on the weekends. Altogether their extra work has already gotten them this far, and they just need a little more help to make their dream into a reality. GoFundMe donations will help to cover expenses for the following events:

- The Southern California Interclub Invitational Series Final (Sep 2018)
- Intermediate Pair Skating Regionals in Anaheim (Oct 2018)
- Intermediate Pair Skating Sectionals in Salt Lake City (Nov 2018)
- Intermediate Pair Skating Nationals in Detroit (Jan 2019)

More and more homes, businesses and lives are lost every fire season. EVERY fire season our resources are spread so thin. I am a first responder aka volunteer Firefighter. I have been called to help a few times. I responded to the 2007 Harris fire, the 2014 Poinsettia fire and the 2016 4S Ranch fire, and just recently, the Lilac fire. I saw 4 firefighters with 1 fire truck trying to save 3 houses side by side... unfortunately with no prevail. It actually spread to many other houses and they had to evacuate the area and let them burn. I see it every time. Most of the time they run out of water or the pressure becomes extremely low. Every time I am called to help, I go down to the local truck rental company and rent a 2000 gallon water tanker. It is not cheap, but I do it without hesitation. I tell ya something... It is a wonderful feeling to help and save homes, animals and lives. I want to be able to help more. I have a Commercial License which allows me to drive a water tanker. So this is my plan... I am going to buy a 4000 gallon water truck and get it fire certified. That way when the fire season hits I can help save house's, businesses and most importantly... lives. Calfire, and other local agencies lease water tankers from anyone who owns one. They lease 4000 gallon trucks that have been certified only. The more money I make the more trucks I can buy and have ready for the next fire season. I have been looking and shopping for water tanker trucks. I figure I can buy one for about 40k-50k give or take. Then another 25k for maintenance, insurance, certifications and licensing, retrofitting the truck with hoses and fire protection devices. Not to mention a place to store the truck(s) when not in use. I'm sure I will need more, but anything will help me reach my goal. I'd like to be able to put your name  on the truck  as a thank you for your donations.  If a business  would like to donate  the business name can be added to the side of the truck as a thank you.  If you wish to stay anonymous that is okay too if that is your wish. If a business wants to donate a vehicle or water truck, I would think you would be able to also use it as a tax write-off.  I'd be happy to put your name on the truck. If WE can get this up and running and flourishing, I want to be able to help out fire victims with profits made also. Thank you very much, and be safe out there people. God Bless.

                        Heroic nurse hero needs your help !",https://www.gofundme.com/heroic-nurse-looses-everything-continues-to-care-for-others,Heroic nurse hero needs your help !,"Julayne Smithson, RN, is an ICU nurse at Kaiser Santa Rosa who lost her home and everything she owns--while focused on safely evacuating her patients during the deadly California wildfires.  As fire surrounded the hospital Monday morning, Julayne was doing more of what she does best: giving her ALL to those in her care. 
You may have seen this heroic nurse in a widely-shared video, running her patient out of Kaiser Santa Rosa, with fire looming in the background. 

Julayne said, the night of 10/9/17 in the ICU started out just like any other night. Julayne was preoccupied caring for a patient that was very critical. A fellow nurse told Julayne her ""home is going to burn"". Julayne rushed to the window, saw flames right behind her home and knew she was going to loose everything. Julayne asked a fellow nurse to watch her patient and she ran across the parking lot with only one objective.....to grab her nursing credentials. Julayne  said:  ""I have to get my nursing documents, because if I'm going to lose everything I own, I have to be able to work and continue to care for patients.""

Julayne entered her smoke filled home guided by the flashlight on her phone. Julayne grabbed three things: a nursing folder containing her professional documents, one pair of scrubs and a nightgown. Julayne crawled back out the door passing many other valuables she was tempted to grab; but, there was no time. The embers were now flying onto her home as she ran back across the parking lot and returned to work. As Julayne sat down, she remembered a stash of emergency cash funds that she had forgotten about and realized by now the money was gone.  

Julayne resumed care of her Kaiser ICU patient and minutes later, the police busted through the ICU doors and ordered the nurses to ""get your patients and get out"". The nurses began the evacuation and Julayne only thought of her patients safety. Julayne ran to the medication room to grab 3 bottles of IV sedation.... Diprivan. Julayne knew her patients Versed and Fentanyl drips would run out within 10 minutes. Diprivan was the only alternative available to keep her patient sedated and safe during such an emergency transport. 

The nurses pushed the patients outside into the hospital parking lot. The flames were getting closer; yet, there were not enough ambulances to evacuate the patients so they kept moving the patient further along the parking lot as flying embers got closer. The critical patients were safely transferred to Santa Rosa Memorial, trauma hospital.

What you might not know is that Julayne had just purchased her mobile home beside Kaiser Santa Rosa three weeks earlier--and had been so busy working doubles that she had not yet secured insurance on her new home.  Julayne recalls how many hours she had been working for the past year.  And, the past couple weeks she was so busy working many double shifts and and she kept putting off getting her insurance for a ""tomorrow"" that never came. 

Julayne said she often felt bad about what she didn't have compared to others that seems to ""have more"" and seemed to have an ""easier life"".  Julayne and her husband were thrilled with the purchase of their recent home.  But, Julayne often worried what others really thought about someone only being able to buy a mobile home instead of a home.  Julayne said, ""quite frankly, that little cheap home was all we really needed to be happy"". 

At 0730 on 10/9, Julayne was released from her duties at Kaiser Santa Rosa.  Julayne knew she had ""lost everything"" yet she kept on GIVING  and drove to Kaiser San Rafael and began working for the next 24 hours day and all night.  Julayne supported Kaiser San Rafael nurses who had received a massive influx of pataients when Kaiser Santa Rosa evacuated.  Julayne remained at Kaiser San Rafael and worked the next four night shifts. 

Although Julayne was uninsured and has lost everything she owned; she remains positive. Julayne says she is more fortunate than most because she lost less than many others and she continues to have her job. Julayne said she felt bad about many personal trajedies that she has faced over the past few years and how difficult her life had become. 

Julayne was asked what she has learned from this experience and she said. ""we cannot take any of our possessions with us, be happy with what you have no matter how small they may seem compared to what others have"".

Julayne Smithson is an unassuming hero, and her patients are safe thanks to her passion for being the best nurse she can be. Let's help her rebuild a modest home and get BACK what she has given. The goal is set at 50K, which is far less than the price of a home and all one's belongings, but which would be a well-deserved boost to get Julayne's life back on track.

Many of you know that this community is my hometown.  Malibou Lake has always been my Sanctuary.  My connection and love for nature was born here as well as bonds with my community.  Another strong tie to the lake was not only being born to my home on South Lakeshore Drive but  for my sisters and brother to grow up there and finally going through the passing of my father, John McFaul after a battle with esophageal cancer in the same home.  Needless to say Malibou Lake is not just a house where I spent some of my childhood but it is my roots, the rivers that feed into that lake are in my blood.  I was fashioned from that hidden little gem in the Santa Monica Mountains.  

So out of my love for the community and current residents of the lake, I want to support the rebirth of a community that has given so much to me and many others.  

I am not going to pretend to know what the victims of the wildfires need.  What I would like to do is purchase gift cards for these families to go buy the things that would help them most.  All of the money will go directly to the families that have lost their home at the lake.  

Thank you for anything you can contribute!  It will make a huge difference to provide some love, comfort and support.

In greatest appreciation and love, 
Christina McFaul

Combined, these fires covered an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.

In Butte County, the Camp Fire is now the most destructive fire in California history. So far, it has burned more than 153,000 acres, killing 81 and destroying more than 18,000 structures. The fire has forced hundreds of thousands of residents from their homes and left most of the town of Paradise in ruins. As of November 21, the fire was 80% contained.

The immediate needs of those affected by Northern California wildfires are great, and the recovery process will be long and difficult in communities throughout the state.

Details about the HPE Program

Wildfires are raging in California again, forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate and destroying homes and livelihoods in multiple counties across the state. As of November 12 at least 31 people have been killed by this month’s fires, and at least 228 people are missing.

In addition to HPE Foundation's longstanding support for the American Red Cross (ARC) Disaster Responder Program, it will now match employee donations via this special disaster matching campaign to the Wildfire Relief Fund, up to $100,000 USD total, and up to $1,000 USD per employee. Matching funds for this disaster relief campaign are separate from and do not impact your annual HPE Gives limit of $5,000 USD per employee.

The California Community Foundation’s Wildfire Relief Fund supports intermediate and long-term recovery efforts for major California wildfires, as well as preparedness efforts. Funds will be used to support those who were displaced or lost housing, belongings and/or employment, or suffered physical or mental health problems; help to rebuild homes; provide case management services, basic needs assistance, mental health services and financial assistance; and much more.

If you or someone you know is impacted by the fires, ARC has provided this resource on shelter information and general wildfire safety tips.

Our mission is to raise $1000 to donate to the California Fire Foundation. California’s 2018 wildfires have burned over 800,000 acres with death tolls and destruction continuously rising.  The California Fire Foundation focuses on providing emotional and financial support to families of fallen firefighters, firefighters, and the communities they protect.

The deadly wildfires ripping through California have forced hundreds of thousands of residents to evacuate leaving everything behind. Lives and homes have been lost in affected areas. The Woolsey fire has burned over 70,000 acres and has reached the Pacific Coast at Malibu. People and animals have been displaced, while the fires continue to rage on. Our firefighters, emergency services, and fellow citizens have been heroes throughout this disaster and continue to fight on behalf of all residents.

The Red Cross works 24/7 to be ready to respond to disasters like wildfires and other countless crises. To ensure the funds go directly to the wildfire emergency in California, I will be withdrawing all donations to my account and making one lump sum donation directly to the Red Cross California Wildfires fund. Once that donation is made, I will share that update with you!

We all stopped and rushed to the couch. We ripped the couch open and here is the cat we really thought was a goner. He had gotten outside a few months past and got into a fight and broke his paw, so he can't run. But he managed to find a way to survive and he's doing great.

First, thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

My best friend Almamy Kabba has had an incredibly difficult year filled with unexpected challenges. Though he has been working hard to save money and resolve financial struggles, unforeseen circumstances thrown into his path have derailed his efforts, and we need assistance to help him reach his long term educational goals.

As many of you may know, Almamy’s father passed away unexpectedly while visiting family in Africa. During that time, Almamy had to take off work to be with family and visit Africa causing more financial strain amid managing his and his younger brothers’ grief process. The support of our community allowed for some ease on his family’s financial situation and peace of mind during an immensely difficult time. 

However, just a few weeks later, Almamy suffered a car accident while on his way to work, completely totaling his car. Luckily, he was not seriously injured, but his car was his only mode of transportation to work—which is his only source of income. Over the last months, Almamy has struggled to pay his insurance for a rental car to be able to work, pay his bills, and support himself and his family.

At this time, Almamy has passed his exams and has been accepted into a nursing program! He will finally be able to fulfill his dream of supporting others and giving back to his community. Unfortunately, the nursing school tuition is too high for his family to afford, and aid will only cover a portion of the expenses.

Today, we ask for your help in supporting Almamy in achieving his dream of becoming a nurse. Any donation amount helps and all proceeds from this fundraiser will go directly to his education (predominantly tuition, but any excess will be spent on books and supplies).

We understand that many of you may be affected by the wildfires in California and the recent mass shooting tragedy and are currently unable to donate at this time. We ask that you share this fundraiser widely and spread the word! 

Thank you for your time. We deeply appreciate you!",1080,10000,19,20,186,"STOCKTON, CA"," November 19, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34666464_1542615485959324_r.jpg,20,186,19,0.9853,2089,10000,0.10800000000000001,0,0,['tree']

Earlier this month, my dad Hoji was diagnosed with stage 1 cancer. Scans revealed two tumors in his neck that will need to be surgically removed. Fortunately, the doctors say the procedure is not complicated and the recovery time is relatively short. But paying for it will not be as easy.

Insurance will cover most of the costs and my parents are still awaiting a full breakdown of expenses, but between the many doctor visits, exams, scans, the procedure itself, and the week my dad will be in recovery and out of work, my family is looking at over $20,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. Both of my parents are self-employed and any time lost sitting in a hospital has been money lost too. They're both incredibly hard workers who have done so much for me and my brother and if we can try to fight this financial setback for them, we're going to do everything we can.

Absolutely anything helps, and if you can't donate, please share this page!

All money raised for our goal will go towards medical expenses for my dad (copay for doctor visits, scans, the surgery, any potential medication he'll require, and whatever else the hospital might throw at us), potential living expenses incurred from his health situation, and GoFundMe fees. If people are so generous that we raise anything significantly extra by the time this situation is behind us, the remaining funds will be put towards California wildfire relief. I will eventually add my dad as a beneficiary to this campaign so he can withdraw the funds and my parents will handle the finances from there. I will do my best to keep you all updated.

Thank you all so much. <3

Once the immediate needs are met, the fund will transition to supporting long-term recovery efforts. As you can imagine, they do not know exactly what those needs will be, but the money will ultimately go to supporting victims of the Camp Fire.

Donate any amount to raise funds to give 2 of our Emergency Response Vehicles (ERV) and 2 of our GEN-350 Atmospheric Water Generators to fire rescue units.  All funds will be used to give these units to Fire and Rescue departments for them to place in the areas most affected in the Northern and Southern wildfires. First Aid supplies will also be stored in the compartments on each vehicle. Staff will be trained to operate the units and be able to keep them for future use.

$10.00 - Even $10 dollars will impact 5 families by providing them with a gallon of water and a reusable container, reducing plastic waste.

We are raising funds to bring 2 of our Emergency Response Vehicles (ERV) and 2 of our GEN-350 Atmospheric  Water Generators which creates Water-From-Air. **No wasteful plastic bottles or having to truck in cases of water.**

Our GEN-350 water generators can produce 156 gallons a day and sometimes more when running 24 hours. 

WatergenUSA will match the $300,000 if our goal is raised. 300k+300k = $600,000 will be spent to supply drinking water to California Wildfire areas!

We have worked with the Red Cross and FEMA in Florida and Texas following the disasters created by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Michael where we provided crucial on-site water throughout the rescue and recovery.

Our machines also filter the air as we  take in the humidity, creating a constant flow of the most pure and clean drinking water.

The machines will be delivered to Fire and Rescue departments for them to place in the areas most affected in the Northern and Southern wildfires. First Aid supplies will also be stored in the compartments on each vehicle.

Our ERVs are mobile and are able to reach areas where most trucks and other water sources can't get access to.

Jenna, Sean and Darla


In the early morning of October 9th, 2017, my sister Jenna and brother in law Sean, lost their home to The Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California. They were evacuated from their home at 2 am and luckily they made it out safe with their cat, dog and a few important items.  They purchased the house together in November, 2014 and have been working on making it their perfect home ever since.  We are deeply saddened at the loss of their home and everything they owned but most importantly we are happy that they made it to safety. 

As you may know, Jenna graduated from the Radiology Tech Program in July. She has been out of work since waiting on her license to arrive. She has been offered a position at a local hospital but isn't scheduled to start work until November. Due to this unexpected disaster it is hard to say how her starting work will be affected. 

Any donations will help Sean and Jenna to stay on their feet and get the supplies they need to be able to get through this tragedy. 

Thank you,

Over the past year, there have been many changes to life with graduating high school, going to college at the University of Kentucky, and God placing me in a fresh season of life. 

           

In the Spring of 2017, I was blessed to partner with Life in Abundance in going to Jamaica and reaching out to the community in any way possible. While being there, the team and I were able to scatter the seeds of the Gospel and reach out to the community. After that trip, my heart for missions has only continued to grow. I am excited that I have been presented with an opportunity to go on another trip this coming Spring.

 

Recently, in October of 2017, wildfires plagued much of California. These fires destroyed many homes and vastly affected the lives of California residents. From March 9nd-16th, a team of college students and leaders from Kentucky’s Christian Student Fellowship will fly out to Los Angeles, California to help with relief in the area. We are partnering with Youth With a Mission (YWAM), Dream Center, and Mission Church to aid the victims of the fires, as well as any needs of the community through serving food and personal evangelism. We hope to serve them well and share the good news of the Gospel. 

 

I will need your prayers while being on this trip. Please pray that God’s presence will be felt in the hearts of the people that we will be reaching and that our team will complete the work that the Lord has waiting for us. I will also need financial donations in order to assist in spreading the Gospel and planting seeds. The total cost of the trip is $780, and with your prayerful support, I hope to reach this goal. Any sort of donation will help this trip in benefitting the kingdom, and I would be incredibly grateful for your support. If you are willing to donate by check, please make donations payable to Your contribution is tax deductible and funds are due by mid-February.

 

Thank you for your consideration in partnering with me.

The fire, which began November 8 on Camp Creek Road in Butte County, has already destroyed 151,000 acres and 16,838 structures, 12,637 of which were homes. As of today, November 20, 2018, the death toll has reached 79 civilians, with700 residents still missing.

Despite serious efforts of containment, authorities warn that the fire isn't even half over. There is some hope that the heavy rains expected this week will progress the containment of the fire, however, it also has the potential to bring flash flooding and mudslides. 

This Gofundme will split the proceeds between I Fund a Hero, an official fundraising platform for firefighters and their families in the Sonoma, Napa, Solano, Lake, and Mendocino counties, and California Fire Foundation which provides emotional and financial support to the families of fallen firefighters.

John had received a job offer with a local company as a helicopter pilot and Abby found employment soon after as an ophthalmic technician. The couple worked hard to get their feet on the ground and were looking forward to their upcoming wedding day, December 22nd. 

￼￼In early December, the St. Thomas wildfire began unexpectedly, quickly turning into the largest wildfire in California history. Incidentally, John and his work company were responsible for fighting the fire via helicopter. The fire rapidly spread to less than a mile from their new neighborhood, forcing them to evacuate their home and relocate on three separate occasions. They were only able to return a week before their wedding. 

￼￼On their wedding day, Mad Max (the younger of their two puppies) escaped through a crack in the backyard fence of the cabin that had been rented for the wedding in Northern California. Abby immediately noticed his absence and set out to look for him, finding him shortly after under their front porch cowering from a large unknown dog that was in the process of being restrained by it’s owner. The large dog had apparently been loose and it was later discovered through X-ray and ultrasound that teethmarks had penetrated Max’s neck, with other injuries including two broken ribs, trauma, brain damage, and internal bleeding. Max was rushed to a local vet clinic. Abby & John delayed the wedding, and only after receiving news that Max was stabilizing, had a quick ceremony on Lake Tahoe before rushing to the clinic, skipping their wedding dinner. Per the vet’s request, Max was transferred from a local clinic to the nearest 24-hour hospital in Reno, NV. During the transfer, his body temperature dropped below 90 and he required resuscitation immediately upon arrival. Within the hour, it was clear that he wasn’t going to make it, and Abby & John buried him the day after their wedding. 

￼￼My family has always been very private but the vet bills surpassed $2,500 and therefore I’m starting this GoFundMe with the hope of alleviating some of the burden the new couple is already carrying. Any amount over the goal will be donated to their local community of Ojai, CA to help those affected by the wildfire. 

Thank you for your support and happy holidays.

Thursday morning, November 8th, the residents of Paradise, CA were evacuated due to a rainstorm of burning debris from a nearby forest fire. The fire spread so rapidly many (like my brother Caleb) were stranded and caught between walls of fire with closed roads in all directions. Fire fighters were focused solely on evacuation because the fire raged with 0% containment for over 24 hours, resulting in ~ 80% of the town being destroyed. 

The Wilner homestead was leveled, only the houses foundation and stone chimney survive.

He even had created multiple tools to work on is prized Model A's, as well as clients antique vehicles. Also gone is Amy's personal glass studio where her post-retirement creativity produced gorgeous and functional pieces of art. The loss of this home has also impacted my 12 yo nephew Brody who is living with Louis and Amy, enrolled in 7th grade and involved in almost every activity in his age group. 

Louis and Amy are my parents and have lived in Paradise for over 30 years,  they are deeply ingrained in the community.  I recently moved to Houston  on the heels of Hurricane Harvey and was blessed to be a part of the recovery efforts.  Now I'm sitting in TX watching another natural disaster affect loved ones across the country and asking for your help.  This request is being promoted by the whole Wilner family, any amount of support is appreciated!

This is an SOS for urgent support so we can meet the rising demands of the world today. At the time of this writing, we are organizing clinics to support people affected by the Northern and Southern California wildfires. 

With your volunteer work and support, Acupuncturists Without Borders has been working tirelessly for 13 years to provide over one million FREE acupuncture treatments for people impacted by hurricanes, shootings, wildfires, poverty, tornadoes, war, oppression, sex trafficking, abuse, and the refugee crisis.  



As the world changes, the need for this trauma relief work is increasing exponentially and with less support for non profits, AWB is struggling to keep going. We are so grateful for you, our friends, and we need your help once again. 

To fully fund all our vital programs, meet the rising needs of our communities, and keep our doors open, we need to raise $10,000 in the next 30 days. And we have a matching donor so every dollar you give is worth double!



With these funds we can continue to:

- respond to disasters, shootings, environmental devastation, human conflict, and other emergencies; 
- provide regular acupuncture to people in Haiti; 
- support clinics serving veterans in the U.S.; 
- provide the medicine of peace in Israel and the West Bank
- serve Spanish speaking citizens and refugees affected by immigration policies; 
- train health care practitioners in Oaxaca; 
- help continue clinics for Nepali children affected by sex and organ trafficking; 
- support Syrian refugees struggling in Greek camps where our Greek AWB acupuncturists treat them weekly
- bring cutting edge trauma-informed training to health care providers all over the world

...we are ready to go, we have solid long-term plans for sustainability, but we must raise this money now to keep answering the calls, creating training health care practitioners, mentoring new community clinics .  

Can you give $1000, $500, $250, $100, $50 today (or any amount possible for you) towards our goal to keep our organization alive,  kicking, and READY TO GO?

INFO ABOUT US
We are Acupuncturists Without Borders, a 501C-3 non-profit organization. Our office is located in Portland, OR but we train health care practitioners all over the world to create mobile clinics where they provide ear acupuncture for trauma relief after a natural disaster or human conflict.  The acupuncturists/health care workers then go on to create clinics to serve populations who have need in their local area. We have programs in the US, Nepal, Haiti, Israel/West Bank, and Greece.

Knowing that my folks will have so many expenses ahead (many known but many unforeseen), we want you to know that we just raised the goal because we continue to hear from many who are looking for a way to help and we didn't want to inadvertently ""cap"" these thoughtful gifts. So thanks in advance for continuing to help us spread the word by sharing this post/site.

When we started this fundraising effort on behalf of our parents, we had no idea where to start or what to expect. We have already surpassed our original fundraising goal... THANK YOU! My brother and I and our wives couldn't be more thrilled and thankful for the generous outpouring of care for my parents through your generous contributions! 

Funds raised here don't take away the pain, there will still be much loss and grief, but your incredibly thoughtful and caring donations will certainly ease some of the practical needs that result from having lost their home and everything in it. So once again, THANK YOU and God bless!

UPDATE #2
I just changed the cover photo. This photo was taken inside my parents neighborhood, only about 100 yards from where their home once stood.

UPDATE #1
This is Derek. On Sunday, my son and I drove to a place near Yuba City, CA, towing our travel trailer. We left it with my folks (John & Earlene Olson) so they can live in it for the short-term while they figure out next steps after losing their home/everything in the wildfire that destroyed. Trevor and I are back home in Oregon now. 

This link is to a news article that gives stark insight into the speed of and destruction caused by this wildfire. -  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/amp-stories/how-the-camp-fire-overwhelmed-paradise/

The GoFundMe that my brother Jaron and I started for them is such an incredible encouragement in the midst of the major pain/heart-wrenching unknowns. Their immediate expenses include the campground they are living in, food, and shopping for clothes. 

Our whole family (including of course my parents) is extremely thankful for your generosity and even more thankful for your ongoing care and prayers! 

And thanks to all who have shared this link online. We also invite you to email this link to any of my parents friends who are not on Facebook or to anyone else you think may want to help - https://www.gofundme.com/jampe-olsonlost-home-in-camp-fire

ORIGINAL POST:
My name is Derek Olson (from Dallas, Oregon). My brother, Jaron Olson (from Santa Cruz, CA), and I are setting this up for our parents, John and Earlene Olson. On Thursday, they safely evacuated out of the path of the Camp Fire that recently swept through their town (Paradise, CA) but they have lost their home and everything in it. They got out with only one of their vehicles, a few belongings and their dogs. Their second vehicle and travel trailer are also gone. 

We are thankful to God that they got out alive. And we are thankful for the many people who are already reaching out to help and care for my folks in any way. Please pray for them and all those affected by this tragic fire.

The Camp Fire is the most destructive wildfire in California history... so far taking 9 lives and burning over 6,700 structures... it currently has burned over 90,000 acres and is still only 20% contained. 52,000 people were evacuated. Fire officials said the town of Paradise was ""pretty much destroyed.""

We are setting this up to help my folks with all the immediate and unknown expenses that are ahead. They are currently figuring out where to live temporarily, will need to begin replacing basic necessities, and then eventually will almost certainly have costs that go beyond insurance coverage. They are ""beneficiaries"" of this GoFundMe effort so they will be able to withdraw funds directly... so you can rest assured your contributions will get directly to them.",32727,50000,245,243,856,"PARADISE, CA"," November 10, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34398140_154247521181903_r.jpeg,243,856,245,0.9990000000000001,3891,50000,0.65454,0,0,"['property', 'home', 'house', 'siding', 'land lot', 'shed', 'facade', 'real estate', 'roof', 'window']"

Our morning started out like any other morning, I wake my daughter Xylea and get her ready for her second grade class. The only thing that stood out to me that morning was how grey the sky looked. Little did we know that only 30 minutes later we would be fleeing for our lives. I was so truly blessed to get all my family out of there, even our extended family, and all our fur babies. I thank god everyday for that. I am truly grateful for our first responders and firefighters for putting that evil fire to bed. Now, I stand in the ashes of what was once my safe haven; my home. I feel like a failure, so much was taken from us and there was nothing we could do about it. My poor husband gets flashbacks and anxiety every time we get stuck in really bad traffic -it took us five hours to escape from the fire- This has changed our whole world. We are jobless, school-less, and homeless and I can’t find housing ANYWHERE. Right now we are all staying in a two bed motel with my mom and her husband, I am grateful we at least have this space even though the five of us are very crammed. What I fear is we will not be able to afford this lifestyle of living in motels, eating out because we don’t have a kitchen or a fridge to put it in. We also have two larger size dogs and two cats with us, we can’t leave the dogs unattended so this adds more stress to an already stressful situation -where ever we go we have to take them with us- This has become a living nightmare for us. I feel so hopeless, but I can’t give up. I have to stay strong for my daughter. It has taken all the strength and courage I could muster up to ask for help. There are many of my fellow townspeople who need just as much help, but I know there is just as many kindhearted people that are willing to help us all. I’m coming up with unique ideas to help our situation. Right now affordable housing is very hard to find, especially considering the circumstances, and with no job, makes its even harder. I have always been a DIY kind of person, with a love and knack for design. So I want to convert a bus into a skoolie for a temporary housing situation for my family. We want the security of having a roof over our heads and clean water, but we want the flexibility to travel around and find ourselves a new home. We are interested in moving out of state, but don’t know where to begin, so the skoolie was my idea to check our country so we can find our new home. All donations will go towards this project, it will cost us some money and resource, but we’re hoping with your help we can make this dream come true. Whatever isn’t spent on the bus will go to whoever else in our family needs help.

Just over two years ago, she was losing her home in Southern California. 


My husband and I, along with my sister and her family went to help her out.  We moved her closer to us in Northern California.  We got her nice property with a fixer upper double wide mobile home. For four months we spent our weekends getting it ready for her. She was so excited to start a new life in a beautiful community

California’s “Camp” wildfire has been the deadliest most destructive wildfire in California history.   Although we both lost our homes, I’m more concerned with her getting back into a home because she did not have insurance. 

Most insurance companies would not insure her property due the location of her home.  She has nothing left. My heart breaks for my mom. I just want to her to live the rest of her life happy & healthy. 

Any amount donated will go directly to purchasing a new or used mobile home for her property. 

God bless.

My name name is Gina Ejtimayee, I  am speaking on behalf of Rozita Karimi and her family.  On November 8, 2018 Rozita and her families lives changed forever when their home was burned down to ashes. The monstrous blaze took people by surprise. Huge walls of flame, fed by piles of branches and bark left from logging operations, roared into towns.

Rozita Karimi, her husband Saed and their 14 year old son escaped the monstrous fire near their home but soon after they had found themselves caught in between the scorching fires through the road, luckily  through prayers and hope they made it safe. 

What makes the Rozita families situation even more precarious is that they did not have homeowners insurance and they are left completely homeless. The reason they did not have homeowners insurance because they were denied coverage by the insurance companies due to her Husband Saed, who is a contractor. Saed was working on the fixer upper which was a 37 year old manufactured home and the insurance required the electrical be up to code before they would insure the property.

The Karimi family would very much appreciate your support. If you would like to donate to Rozita and her family directly on the Facebook fundraiser, please click on the link below.  


Thank you.

Although, I had my two children I had to work very hard because I was a single mother. In my free time I did my hobby:to write. I have creative nonfiction articles, hundreds of short stories and poems in my mother language. Because I was new in the US I draw a taxi in San Diego at last for fifteen years, at night 10-14 hours/ night, without day offs, vacations or holidays.  In 2005 I sold my taxi, and invested my money in a restaurant business. Half years later the California wild fire was destroying it and I was loosing my all life savings:The insurance company of course found excuse to pay my damages. The stress and the lots of work were destroying my health. Within a year I was broken, without any savings, job, and good health. I started to study English, and I was planning to get the Association Degree in Journalism. Unfortunately my health was worse and I planned to committe suicide. I was totally depressed and I have this depression in this days too. Two years ago I had been disabled that it is let me with a $540.00/ month income. This money is not enough to rent a room in and around San Diego. I started this fundraising website with a hope that people are so generous and donate a few dollars to help in my worst housing situation. I was brought an RV and was live in around San Diego, but the parking regulations are very straight here, so I was moving with it to Julian, California. Unfortunately, the RV was broking down, so I can't drive around with it. The RV parks are everywhere more than $ 450.00/month so I can't afford it.

Kenneth is a retired Marine Corps Veteran and father to a 3 year old daughter, Kimber. The house fire was unexpected and fast. In a short time, he lost his entire home, many things that cannot be replaced. This house was also our childhood home, so while also losing the material items, many memories have been burned down to ashes.
While insurance will be helping, it by no means will cover everything they’ve lost, and will likely take awhile to come together. Besides their deductible, they will need to replace their personal effects, buy clothes, find temporary housing for several months and still pay normal bills. During this time, we are asking that if you can help, please know that whatever you can do, will make a difference and will be incredibly appreciated as they try to cope with this life altering event. ALL FUNDS WILL BE WITHDRAWN AND ACCESSIBLE TO KENNY ONLY. 

We cannot escape the tragedies that arise in our lives. We can search for a reason and ask – why? Maybe we could hold others at fault or imagine what life would be had this not happened, but perhaps what defines our character is not our struggles but how well we meet them and rise up after getting knocked down.
Faith will overcome fears, doubt and insecurities. Sometimes in life we don't recognize how strong we actually are until we are faced with a great tragedy in our life. This calamity we face today will help develop the strength and fortitude we need for tomorrow.
Losing everything we own is sad, but the things we own do not diminish who we are inside. Sometimes the worst situation brings out the best in us and others.
When you put together a jigsaw puzzle made of hundreds of pieces, you put it together one piece at a time. No one can go back and change what has happened, but we can all start today and make a new tomorrow, one shovel at a time, one day at a time.

I have found that each disaster is unique and presents its own set of problems to address.  The podcast will explore and educate listeners on plans, policies, procedures & strategies that are in place to help mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from both man-made and natural disasters.  The podcast will explore and highlight the strengths as well as identify potential gaps within each topic.  It is the intent of the podcast to make you the listener better educated on emergency disaster subjects as well as assist the listener in implementing these topics into their everyday life, family, or business.  

Emerging Emergencies will review recent disaster case studies as well as interview subject matter experts in the disaster and emergency management field.  I hope you join me in helping to better educate the world on disasters.

We will perform a needs assessment and provide our assistance in whatever capacity is most needed. Monsoon season is approaching and thousands of people are without shelter. One of our goals is to supply tents to the people of Nepal.

This Bank will develop community projects, create funding for local business's, and utilize Blockchain Technology for digital transactions via our ARCS™ (Active Resale Currency System) Bank product. An innovative Cryptocurrency created by Crenvu and backed by Bank assets. As a ""Public Bank"", we will not be driven by profit as all of the other Corporate banks are . The Bank Of Palm Springs will focus it's profits on building community initiatives. This will not only create a Banking option for the Cannabis industry, but will also create Financing and Loans for citizens to develop wealth with low interest rates. The Bank Of Palm Springs™will also take part in funding local causes including but not limited to Wildfires Relief, Desert Aids Project, Global Warming Awareness, Renewable Energy Infrastructure Development, Endangered Species Initiatives, and Water Distribution Technology. Our Banks Motto is ""Equality In It's Finance"". We are using initial funding to hire advisor's and Executives with our same mission. The board of this Bank will vote with the people holding accounts to assure the Banks best interests are met, which is the wellfare of Californian citizens . There are currently 12 cities attempting to create a State Chartered Public Bank. The Bank of North Dakota is the only existing Public Bank in the USA right now. They survived the 2008 financial crisis because they controlled their own assets, and kept money available for their citizens and business's. North Dakota currently has the lowest unemployment rate in the country. Other Cities and States that are trying to pass bills for Public Banks are: San Francisco, CA - Oakland, CA - Philladelphia, PA - Sante Fe, NM - Arizona - Hawaii - Illinois - Maine - Minnesota - New Hampshire - Vermont - Washington (as of August 2017) . All the listed states with Cannabis programs will allow the Cannabis business's to hold accounts at said Public Banks. I would like to Open the First Public Bank of California in Palm Springs as a test site for the rest of the Californian cities to follow suit. The ARCS™ will allow the bank and it's clients to transfer value without an FDIC accredidation. Unlike Bitcoin or other Cryptocurrencies the ARCS™ value will be backed by the Bank Of Palm Springs cash assets. This will create a VIV™ (Virtual Intrinsic Value) for the currency system. The blockchain technology will also allow for B2B and B2C Taxes to be paid to the cities Wallet, and cashed out by the Bank when needed. This is my company and personal mission, thank you.

Funds raised distribution-
1. the first $300,000-500,000 will be used to hire Bank staff and Economic Advisors to present this project to the City Of Palm Springs. Develop and petition for the State Charter. Salary will be paid through my company Crenvu, to me and my Advisors (approximately 10 individuals YTBD). 
2. $50,000-100,000 of funds will be used to refine the ARCS™(Active Resale Currency System)  Cryptocurrency technology and get the associated Patent and Trademarks secured. Paid to Associated developers through the Crenvu Company account.
3. $500,000 will be held for the operational cashflow of the Bank Of Palm Springs upon approval by the City Of Palm Springs. 
4. Once the Bank is Chartered any funds left from roughly $1,000,000 mentioned above will go into the construction and branding of the new Bank Of Palm Springs Location. If there is not enough then an additional budget will be made to lease the property and do all remodeling, not totaling in more than $150,000. 
5. An additional $150,000-300,000 of money will be used to host a large scale fundraising event for the Bank to draw in customers, and raise money for the Southern California Wildfires Relief efforts. The profits from this event will be split 50/50 between the wildfire relief and the Banks operational budget to schedule the next fundraising event. The goal for fundraising events will be at least 2 large scale events a year, with budget restrictions on many other small events, and cooperative fundraising events YTBD. Thes events will be hosted to raise money for causes and initiatives that the Board of the Bank approves with an account holder crowd vote equal to one third of the board votes.
6. The only other funds that will be used will be determined by the Bank Of Palm Springs Board Of Directors and CFO at that time.
7. the goal is to generate money for community initiatives, not spend it.

After Crenvu Develops and opens the Bank Of Palm Springs it will only recieve payments from the Bank for organizing fundraising events. All supporting documents will be made transparent to the People of Palm Springs.

I have developed systems for growing Organic Cannabis, Worked with and advised many Cannabis related companies. Done countless hours of market research, and have decided to create banking solutions for the industry and Citizens of California, and hopefully the rest of the nations after that. I believe in helping people who are less fortunate by creating opportunities. I also believe that there are many issues that can be addressed with funds recieved within a Public Banking system that works for it's people, not against them. I am Partnered with a world class production company for any fundraising events, I have some of the top Business advisors in the City Of Palm Springs working directly with me on developments.  Above all else I am an advocate of transparent and fair business practices.

Our Santa Rosa-based volunteer team provides healthy, nourishing, restaurant-quality chef-made meals at no cost for anyone affected by the fires, and anyone who needs a helping hand in the kitchen.

Between Oct. 15 and Nov. 15, we served an estimated 80,000 meals. As of Jan. 1, we restarted our program to focus directly on families who have lost homes. We currently have 35 families who receive 4 meals per week.

We value great food, and since launching have served vegan tofu masala, ahi tuna with farro, stuffed acorn squash and more. All made with ingredients donated by local farmers and ranchers, much of it organic, and prepared by local chefs.


Those local product donations -- organic fruits and veggies from FEED Sonoma (we have a fund to pay our local farmers), pasta from Pasta Etc., bread from Costeaux Bakery, proteins from Victorian Farmstead Meats, and literally hundreds of other other purveyors. We also work with the SRJC culinary program to intake large cuts of meat used in knife skills classes and other food that may have otherwise gone unloved. 





Heather Irwin, a restaurant writer in Sonoma County, created the nonprofit to bring families displaced by the fires together with hundreds of chefs who desperately wanted to help.

What started as a simple plan to hand out prepared meals donated by renowned restaurants like Single Thread in Healdsburg, Two Birds One Stone in Napa and San Francisco's Aster has now turned into a full-on professional cooking operation with a staff of more than 20.

All funds raised will be used to fund our operations to produce meals and go toward paying the local farmers, ranchers and chefs who have so graciously donated their time and ingredients to our cause.

Like any other fledgling organization, we have immediate needs, from buying equipment we can't get donated, to gassing up our donated vans, purchasing pantry items like sugar and flour, paying for extra garbage pickups.

For those of you who don't know the family personally,  this picture was taken on the day of the fire. It was taken after the family was reunited and they'd learned everything was lost.  Despite their losses, the family continues to smile and have faith that prayer and love will help them rebuild their lives.

Although Christia was okay, her home, her job, and her vehicle did not survive the flames.  Christia’s home was completely burned to the ground and with it all of her belongings.  The hospital where she is employed suffered severe damage so for the foreseeable future she has no steady income.

Christia made her way to California 18 years ago to volunteer for 3 months at a farm for rescued animals and fell in love with the state.  Shortly after she relocated to California to make it her home.  In her 30’s she put herself through college and graduated with her degree in Sociology.  She works as a social worker at a hospital helping people at the worst, sometimes most hopeless, moments in their and their families’ lives.  That has always been her heart, helping others.

The fire devastated local communities, parks, and our natural landscapes to near non-recognition and we wanted to help. 

In early January 2018, we had the idea to create American Green Shield. Our vision is to bring some life back into the areas affected by the fire by planting native trees and shrubs. We aim to help local landscapes bounce back to their original state. We are starting small, with our first planting day in the books at Steckel Park in Ojai. Eventually we would like to expand our vision  to multiple locations in Ventura County, including residential communities and other natural areas. Our ultimate goal is to respond to other natural disasters near and far to bring a little green back into the world. 

In order to accomplish this long term goal, we need to achieve short term goals. One of which is to become a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. 

Your contribution to our dream will assist with the following:
- The purchasing of trees and plants.
- The purchasing of gloves, shovels, and other supplies as we expand our volunteer base.
- The development of merchandise to sell and raise funds for the future.
- Marketing, website development, and administrative expenses.
- And ultimately, the creation of a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to expand our impact. 

We are incredibly grateful for all contributions, big or small. Every dollar is one step closer to achieving our dream and doing what we love. With every tree planted, we are one step closer to not only achieving our personal goals, but to bringing a sense of normality and comfort to devastated communities. 

Here's how you can follow our progress, volunteer, find planting days, and more!

Phyllis and her daughter will need... well... everything.  They have immediate shelter opportunities.  But they will need our support in putting the pieces of their lives back together.  In the short term, funds raised will provide food, clothing and basic necessities.  Within a few days to weeks they will need to find a new place to live.

It is difficult to estimate the need, so I picked a number and will  let you decide if and how much you are able to provide.  I know that all donations will be appreciated regardless of the total amount raised.

Because of potential fraud, GoFundMe has advised that I share who I am, where I am from, and how the money will be used.  I am Tammi Hardiman, RN, a friend in Phoenix.  You can find me on Facebook if you need to know more.  I got to know Phyllis through our mutual friend, Karen Tenniswood.  Phyllis and I bonded over many shared life experiences.  100% of all funds collected will be given directly to Phyllis.  I am not willing to set any restrictions on how she might choose to use funds given.  You are welcome to leave a comment if you are donating to help with a specific need.

I'd like to share a few thoughts from Phyllis (with her permission) that reflect her perspective on the wildfire and losing her home.  These are personal insights shared via text when we reconnected;  not written for a fundraising site.  ""This is all surreal.  But I can't even begin to explain how loved I feel.""  People in the store ""are crying, dazed or panicked.'  ""I've just been so aware that I've been given an extra portion of peace"" ""I have been feeling like God has been hugging me.""  ""I don't cry for my stuff or loss, I cry because the friends are so kind and loving, and God.  I know He 's watching all this.  He's got some incredible blessings to come out of this.  That's how our Father is.  LOVE him.""





I know that Phyllis has family as well as other close friends, but I was the first to offer to set up a fund and she graciously accepted.  You are welcome to ask around if you don't know me.  Some days, I am not sure I even know myself!  Family and other friends are encouraged to join  ""Team Phyllis"" for this ""campaign"" to help lend credibility and reach.  Just  let me know and I will add you.  

If I learn of non-monetary needs, I will share those in future updates.  I do not currently have information about clothing sizes, etc.  Household items may be helpful once she has settled in a new place.",11115,20000,75,75,380,"MAGALIA, CA"," November 11, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34414900_154191695659692_r.jpeg,75,380,75,0.9991,2884,20000,0.55575,0,0,"['fire', 'wildfire', 'bonfire', 'forest', 'fireman', 'firefighter', 'campfire']"

Yet in the face of such uncertainty and adversity, they remain the positive people we know them to be. Tom and Pauline have spent their working lives in the service of others. Now they need your help. 

In their own words “Some share our situation and our thoughts are with them all. Something we’ve learned – while we try to rationalize that stuff us just stuff, it’s not really is it? Some things and the memories attached to them are real artifacts of our lives and it hurts to have lost them. Yes, we are safe and that’s the number one thing. But artifacts matter too; a lot.   It was a snug little home on a beautiful setting and we are saddened by its passing. However, we absolutely intend to take all those ashes and turn them into a beautiful new little home on the same site.”

She narrowly escaped with the clothes on her back saving herself and her two small dogs Bruno and Soleil. The Camp Fire has decimated her hometown just weeks before her seventeenth birthday and amidst college application deadlines. This campaign's purpose is to support Juliette's upcoming college expenses and academic endeavors in the face of total loss and destruction. We need your support.

Juliette is my younger sister and an outstanding scholar and citizen. She holds a 3.96 GPA and has the transcripts to prove it. She is in the top 11% of her graduating class and has always challenged herself through advanced courses and leadership positions within her basketball and volleyball teams. During her junior year, Juliette founded Paradise High School's first ever Chemistry Club where students received academic support from peers and staff.

Juliette also worked as a Chemistry Lab Technician, worked local fundraisers to support Paradise youth organizations, wrote and published the 2018 Annual Mock Trial Script for local elementary students, served as the select California Civic Learning Partnership Student Representative with the local Superior Court, and helped the PHS volleyball team to becoming 2017 League Champions, all while working an average of 18.5 hours per week as a server at Feather Canyon Retirement Living and as a Team Member at Joy Lyn's Candies, a local gourmet candy shop holding prestigious awards in the confectioner's realm.

Juliette has goals of attending a four-year university in fall 2019. She will be a first-generation college student hailing from a household headed by a strong single mother. Her academic interests include psychology and business with an emphasis in real estate. The funds raised from this campaign will go directly towards supporting Juliette's educational pursuits.
Please view the chart and images below for a detailed breakdown of how funds raised will be dispersed.

Aside from her extensive list of academic and personal accomplishments, Juliette Sells is an incredibly compassionate and caring young person. She is exactly the kind of individual we call on to become leaders of our world. Juliette has always looked to serve others before herself. Now, I call on others to support this young individual and her bright and promising future. Together, we can rebuild. #ParadiseStrong

Since September of 2017, the world has experienced an unusually large number of disasters, and some hard to reach places have been particularly hard hit. 

We are known for coming to their support after the tv cameras have left, particularly for small municipalities, small, minority businesses, and under-served communities. We have access to a wide range of experts across many disciplines, and we want to send as many of them as possible to these disaster zones for 3-5 days each to work with their local counterparts and help them with their specialized knowledge.

We know this works. Back in the day, the executive director of the Manhattan Chamber, Nancy Ploeger, was so appreciative of the 500+ local chambers that joined hers after 9-11, that she swore she'd pay it forward, and she went to Guam and New Orleans, among other places to help mentor her counterparts. Louisiana chambers helped Cedar Rapids, Cedar Rapids helped Nashville, Tuscaloosa helped Joplin, Joplin helped Moore. We want to take this concept and put it on steroids across a range of disciplines in housing, engineering, finance, communications and technology, particularly in light of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and Michael, Typhoon Yutu and the California Wildfires.

We've received heartbreaking appeals like this one: 

""We just experienced a Category 5+ typhoon, the strongest to hit the US landfall since 1935. Right now our island of Saipan is demolished and neighboring island of Tinian is flattened. I’d say approximately 90% of homes received some sort of damage, and 40% of homes lost a roof/the entire house. Our shelters are maxed out. And almost all of our businesses have experienced damage from the typhoon, and in general, there is no power expected to come back to island for 1-5 months depending on the areas. We also have no running water which should be the case for the next few weeks. This is just to give you an idea of what’s happening right now: It feels like a warzone.

Being so isolated, our business community is critical in providing goods and services to people, especially after disaster. We’re currently working with SBA on establishing their disaster recovery center, but many of the businesses are overwhelmed. We just experienced a Category 4 Typhoon in 2015 where many of the businesses already had to take out loans, and now they are faced with the same burden three years later.""

or this one:

""The situation in Florida/S. Georgia/S. Alabama is worse even than what the media knows to report...This has the potential to be really bad and will take an organized effort to catalyze recovery in this predominantly rural part of the country.:

Your funding will allow us to send skilled experts and volunteers to places that normally can't afford these kind of services.. 

Many of these communities want to get back to normal, they just need temporary assistance to help get them through this shock. However, they don't necessarily know what to ask for, or how to access resources. Our expert volunteers who are willing to donate some or all of their time, but we need to cover the costs that can't be donated. Our experts will help with the initial:

-- Needs Assessments
-- Planning
-- Resilient Housing
-- Infrastructure Requirements
-- and Small Business Recovery

These places may seem small in terms of their population, isolated, and not that important. Because no one is focusing on them, this is precisely why we do.

She has lived in Paradise, CA for a few years, but she and her husband were able to scrape together just enough to purchase a small home there this past August and were well on their way to renovating it with their own blood, sweat, and tears. They literally just put up a white picket fence last month.

Our family is incredibly grateful they made it out with their lives, but there was no time to take anything but a few important papers, some photos, and their animals before they had to escape to Red Bluff.

They are humble people with good hearts and a simple lifestyle. The money would be used to to help them take care of themselves, their two dogs, and their horse while they go through the process of recovering from this horrible tragedy.

Thank you for your kindness.

I am only one, but I am one. 
I cannot do everything, but I can do something.
And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do.

Carol has homeowner’s insurance, but because she lived in a mobile home the insurance payout is woefully inadequate to rebuild.  In California, a mobile home is valued based on when it was built, it doesn’t appreciate in value as a site-built home would.  Carol needs to raise $$$$ to help offset the cost of rebuilding, so she and Ken have a place to spend the balance of their lives together.

Sadly on November 8th, 2018, wildfires broke out in both Northern and Southern California. The Camp Fire managed to wipe out the entire town of Paradise, CA with over 1,000 people still unaccounted for. The Woolsey Fire in Thousand Oaks, CA is only 20 minutes away from our apartment and a mere 10 minutes from my workplace in Simi Valley. 

We have heard several devastating stories surrounding the fires, but the ones that stand out the most to us are centered around displaced animals. The fire evacuations have left animal shelters all across the Los Angeles area at max capacity and we're trying to do our part to eliminate the burden on these extremely important animal rescue foundations. That's why we have made the very spontaneous decision to foster 2 rabbits from the Bunny World Foundation.

We will be receiving the bunnies this Sunday, November 18th. We have been told that there is a shortage of supplies so we will be responsible for the bulk of the items necessary, including but not limited to pellets, hay, carrots, toys, litter pans, water and food dishes, nail clippers, grooming brushes, cages and play pens. We will also be responsible for any vet bills and medications during our foster period. 

While we do not plan on this being a permanent arrangement, we want to give these bunnies the best possible care during their time with us. Several of the shelter's rabbits have been displaced as a result of the California fires and we want to do our part to help rebuild our community that's suffering significant loss right now. Funds raised will go directly to rabbit expenses such as food, supplies and vet bills. Any left over funds after our foster period will be donated to the Bunny World Foundation. 

If you would like to donate directly to the foundation or sponsor a rabbit yourself, please go to the link below:

Thanks to you, we've completed phase 1 of our historical Winnemem Wintu Salmon Restoration Project!

Since launching our gofundme campaign on June 1, 2017, with your help and support we've raised more than $85,000 dollars for phase 1 of our our historical Winnemem Wintu Salmon Restoration Project! This funding allowed our people to travel to Aotearoa (New Zealand) to be reunited with our salmon and work with biologists in Aotearoa (New Zealand) to carefully collect DNA samples of our ancestral salmon. We caught them with nets, took samples and released them again so they could complete their journey upstream to spawn in the rivers that they now call home. As we released them and saw them continue their journey our hope was restored that one day soon, they will also make that journey again on our river, where Creator put them.

Whats next?

WE ARE READY FOR PHASE 2!

The wildfires in California are a painful reminder that the effects of climate change are already here and now more than ever we must continue to fight to bring our salmon home to restore balance to our rivers, lands and people. 

What is the new fundraising goal?
We need to raise another $85,000 dollars to move forward with phase 2 of testing the DNA samples to prove to the government agencies that these are our wild salmon that have the pristine genetics to survive climate change. 

What will the costs cover?
The $85,000 dollars will go towards covering the costs that we will acquire from; hiring our fish biologists, funding our scientists, consulting with our tribal experts and compensating research assistants, lab equipment, travel costs, lab testing fees, and small administrative costs. 

We are making history! 
This has never been done before, but it’s our only chance of saving our Salmon relatives. We predict that some new costs may emerge as the process unfolds and will keep you all updated should anything change but we feel confident in our undertaking. Thank you for your continued support, the time is now to stand together to protect Mother Earth and work to bring balance to our waters, our land and our people.  We are ready to bring our salmon home to our waters. 

Restoring our salmon runs to the high mountain streams is the only hope we have in helping the salmon survive climate change and revitalizing our culture. Join us in this movement, follow our tribe and join us on this journey as we continue to carry out our #Run4Salmon prayer (see more: Run4Salmon.org ) to protect our waters, restore our salmon and revive our culture.

 

We believe in the good things coming,

BRING OUR SALMON HOME
My name is Chief Caleen Sisk of the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, I’m the fifth leader in an unbroken traditional leadership since settler contact . Our ancestral territory expands all along the McCloud River watershed below Bulyum Puyuk (Mt. Shasta). In the 1940s, with the installation of the Shasta Dam, my people were flooded out of our homelands and our Salmon relatives were blocked from returning to their spawning grounds. 
SALMON ARE SACRED.
We believe that when Creator put us on this Earth we had no voice. Our Salmon relatives saw we needed help and gave us their voice.  In return, we promised to always speak for them. Today, climate change, GMO farming, habitat destruction and  water diversions for Big Ag are pushing our salmon relatives towards extinction . Our tribe has an ancient prophecy, “When there are no more salmon, there will be no more Winnemem Wintu people.""  For this reason, we believe that we must do everything we can to bring back our salmon. There is still hope. Our tribe is taking action to save our endangered salmon relatives and restore this keystone species to its rightful place in the natural world.

OUR STORY 

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, salmon eggs were taken from the McCloud River to populate the rivers in other parts of the world. After the Shasta Dam was installed, we thought we had lost our fish forever but in 2004, when news about our War Dance went around the world, a New Zealand professor contacted us saying, “We have your fish, do you want them back?”We learned that the eggs that had been taken to Aotearoa (New Zealand) survived in the glacier-fed rivers and existed in healthy numbers. Now we are on a mission to bring home the genetic descendants of our wild chinook salmon. This June we need to raise $85,000 to begin the process of restoring our wild, genetically pure winter-run, chinook salmon in our California waters. This has never been done before, but it is the only chance we have to save our endangered Salmon relatives.


THE TIME IS NOW

We are working to bring our salmon home.  The descendants of our McCloud River salmon are thriving in Aotearoa (New Zealand), and they’re beginning their spawning journey upstream this month. This July we hope to travel to New Zealand with our tribal youth to collect samples for DNA testing to prove to the U.S. government that the New Zealand salmon are indeed our McCloud river fish. If we can’t complete phase 1, we may not have another chance. It's now or never.  We know that with your help we will make this project a reality.

The money we raise will go towards

+$60K Will go towards hiring the staff and biologists to collect samples of the salmon and New Zealand’s administrative costs. This will also cover campaign fees and administrative costs.

HELP GET US THERE!
Our stretch goal will be to help fund our youth to travel to New Zealand in July to be a part of this historic restoration effort.

+$25k Will help get us to take our tribal youth to New Zealand to be a part of the restoration effort.

This has never been done before, but it’s our only chance of saving our Salmon relatives. We are ready to bring our salmon home to our waters. Restoring our salmon runs to the high mountain streams is the only hope we have in helping the salmon survive climate change and revitalizing our culture.

While there are many wonderful and caring organizations and individuals focused on providing immediate relief
and assistance to the survivors of the recent California wildfires  Parents of Professional, PrepWorld LLC and BAPAC-Sacramento Chapter recognize that the missing piece for many families is trauma-informed recovery. 

HELP FILL THE VOID

The recent California wildfires have become the deadliest disaster in state history, killing and injuring scores of people and destroying billions of dollars of property. First responders from throughout the nation have come to help contain the fires, and dozens of disaster relief agencies have sprung into action to help feed and shelter survivors. However, long after the fires are out, and the disaster shelters have closed, now Californians face the most traumatic and difficult part of the disaster cycle…RECOVERY.

For these survivors, there is a void in what to do after the fire trucks have left, and the shelters have closed. 

DON'T LET ONE DISASTER LEAD TO ANOTHER!

Although there are many great organizations, programs and individuals that work very hard to assist individuals in their recovery efforts, unfortunately not everyone receives the information and messaging in a way that they can use the information to avoid delays and set backs in their recovery efforts. 

Recovery can be challenging, especially in communities where English is a second language and in some part due to all the misinformation and limited access to important and pertinent information. Vulnerable populations such as the elderly, and those with access and functional needs or disabilities can be especially susceptible to predators and scams, unscrupulous contractors, or simply lack of understanding and literacy about the post-disaster world they suddenly find themselves in.

Preparing for recovery can be a daunting task which is why this initiative is so important. The Trauma-informed Recovery Series is designed by experts with over 100 years of experience in trauma informed solutions, disaster response and recovery using engagement knowledge. Ensuring one knows what to do is the key to recovery.



YOUTH IN DISASTERS

Disasters are calamitous events, traumatic and customarily outside the scope of normal human experiences and likely to involve psychological and physical injury. Children are uniquely affected by disasters because they are afflicted not only by the trauma of the event but also by their parents' fear and distress.





During the workshop series attendees will receive tools and information that informs and empower renters and homeowners to navigate the insurance, restoration and recovery systems, as well as FEMA processes and help families avoid being victimized at the most stressful times in their lives.  

Parents will also learn how youth are impacted by disasters because the emotional-effects of disasters on children are not always immediate and can last for years and may also affect their academic-attainment.  Kids will also receive a copy of the Adventures of Hopper from the Hopper's Youth Disaster Literacy Series titled, ""Hopper Learns About Fires!""   

The Adventures of Hopper animated book series takes kids on an easy to read and easy to understand series of events that age-appropriately teaches them how to respond and stay safe while help is on the way and helps them return to their normal life quicker by delivering greater psychological awareness and building confidence as they acclimate to the new-- ""new!""



Thanking you in advance for your support in this most important campaign. We accept donations as little as $5 and although we understand not everyone can donate money, we hope that you spread the message of preparedness so that one disaster doesn't lead to another!

This campaign is to help me replace the belongings I lost in the most destructive wildfire in California history. 

On 20 October 2018 I arrived in Paradise CA from Bloomington, Indiana, my home foe over 35 years, to stay with friends while I located a job and a place to live on the West Coast. On 8 November the Camp Fire broke out, leveling the town of Paradise, including my friends' homes and my trailer.  

I have been reticent to do this, because my losses pale in comparison to most people affected by the Camp Fire.   

But the fact is that all my possessions, excepting what I carry in my van, were lost in the wildfire that consumed Paradise, California.  

As some of you know, before coming to CA, I divested myself of all my possessions except what would fit in my 4x6 cargo trailer.   That trailer and its contents were left at my friend's place in Paradise the day before the fire broke out.  

I was lucky.  I'd gone visiting in the Bay Area the say before.  But my friend's place is ash and rubble.  As are the places of all my friends in Paradise. Thankfully, all the people I know and their four-legged pets made it out alive and are beginning the arduous process of getting resettled. 

Since I was a recent arrival without a local address, there is no backstop for me.   Hence this page.  

Some of the stuff I lost can't be replaced.  So be it. I have memories.  And fortunately I didn't lose any guitars or amps!  But everythung I needed to get settled and start over once I found a place, is gone.  

Donations will be used to replace the essentials I lost in the fire.  This includes clothing, shoes, bed and bath linens, kitchen ware, pots and pans, dishes, glasses, silverware, furnishings, music, books, tools, etc., etc. 

I am appealing to those of you who can comfortably help me.  Some of my friends have children to feed, clothe and educate.  Some live hand-to-mouth.  Some have given already to help victims of so many disasters this year.  Some have health issues.  From you people all I ask is for your good wishes.  No one should feel compelled to donate.   Please.  

But if you can comfortably spare a few bucks to send my way I will be forever grateful.  

Thank you for your time and consideration and in advance for any donations.

Material things can be destroyed, but the passion, love for the sport – and the community – can never end!! 

Our hearts go out to those affected by the fires. As soon as the situation turns from a life-saving effort to a recovery and rebuilding effort, we will work closely with any soccer players in our community to provide cleats, uniforms, clothes, backpacks and soccer equipment so that they can return to normalcy as quickly as possible.

The thousands of families impacted may include – but aren't limited to – members of all of the following youth soccer clubs and High Schools:
 Atletico Santa Rosa, Tahuichi FC,
Black Oaks Soccer Club, Deportivo Santa Rosa, Empire Soccer Club, Santa Rosa South, Santa Rosa United Alliance, Santa Rosa United, 
 Napa Soccer Academy, Napa Sport, Mendocino Soccer Academy, Rohnert Park SC,  Sonoma SC, Sonoma Valley YSA, Napa United, Western Sonoma County, Briceno Soccer Club, North Coast FC, Piner High School, Cardinal Newman High School, and Adults that play and love the sport.

Each of these children will need close to $100-$300 to replace what was lost so that they can return to playing the sport we all love so much.  We have been able to give out over 120- $50 gift cards/credits to community members that have lost their home in the fire to at least get them a start on replacing shoes, socks or anything else they may need soccer related.

Soccer and Sports will also accept donations of lightly-used cleats or equipment in order to provide additional support to our community that has already lost so much.

Many of these children will be trying to play pre-scheduled soccer games as soon as the air quality is healthy again. With your generous donations, Soccer and Sports hopes to provide a place for the communities young players to pick up their needs as soon as possible while their families begin the process of rebuilding their homes and lives.

Thank you especially to Mark DonPineo and Ivan Seifert. I’m infinitely grateful that we worked together so beautifully to navigate through this whirling dervish firestorm. My home, belongings, our beloved Harbin, Middletown, Anderson Springs, Cobb, Hidden Valley and more are gone but we are ALIVE. For this I Surrender to INFINITE GRATITUDE.

At the moment they are having to purchase every meal out. So if you would like to mail a gift card to them in lieu of a donation on gofundme that is something they would also greatly appreciate.

Hello honored Donors, here is the update!  Fortunately (an odd choice of words, I know) only one family, living in Paradise was affected by these latest fires.  Dale and Cherie Sakschewski and their son Lance (w/PWS) lost their home, everything in it, and the family dog.  We will be transferring all funds raised on this site to them as they work to start over in every sense of the word.  They are hopefully going to be able to move out of the hotel and into a house in Chico in the next few weeks; they will be needing all our help to furnish the house and re-supply everything from dishes to toilet paper.  Lance's day program is also gone, so there will be a search for a new program to help him re-establish his routines.  They are very thankful for all your generosity and support during these truly difficult times.  And we thought our day-to-day living with PWS could be challenging!  We are sending the Sakschewski family love, caring, and practical assistance from our wider PWS family.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

California wildfires are affecting families who are also caring for a family member with Prader-Willi Syndrome; it is hard to  imagine the difficulty and trauma of losing your home to wildfire, let alone the anxiety a person with PWS must feel on losing their familiar belongings,  collections, routines, and pets.

Please help to contribute; cash gifts (or gift cards) are best for people who have only their cars for storing belongings, and who are couch surfing at friends' houses while trying to find a more permanent place to try and put the pieces of their lives together again.

If you can donate cash, please do so; if you want to send a gift card, you can contact me for further info.

As we share information, tips & techniques, and personal experiences to support each other in caregiving for someone with PWS, let's also generously share what we can spare for those who have lost so much, and are coping with what will surely be a very difficult holiday season.

Thank you in advance for donating; I believe our PWS family is both large and loving.

Sincerely,
Michelle Donaldson

Animals: The Humane Society of Ventura County

""The Humane Society of Ventura County is open for those who have been evacuated and are in need of sanctuary for dogs, cats, horses or other domesticated animals. Fire officials have issued mandatory evacuations for thousands of homes in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties due to The Hill and Woolsley Incidents.
Our equestrian team is equipped to offer assistance for those in need to evacuate horses. “We were up most of the night answering phone calls and evacuating horses in the path of these fires,” said Jolene Hoffman, Shelter Director for the HSVC. “Our primary concerns is for the safety and welfare of your pets so please do not hesitate to take them to animal rescue centers,” Hoffman continued. “We have increased our capacity in preparation for this year’s fire season and fully staffed to handle the care of all animals brought to our Shelter in Ojai,” said Greg Cooper, Director of Community Outreach for the HSVC.""

Many low-income families and individuals were already struggling to make ends meet in Ventura County before this disaster struck, and we are committed to supporting those who need our resources the most. Donations to the Ventura County Community Disaster Relief Fund will be used across our county and will be directed to the areas of greatest need.""

His home was burnt to nothing but ashes on Monday October 9th, 2017 in the Tubbs Fire. At around 4 am on Monday morning, Omar and thousands of other Santa Rosa, California residents received a call that a wildfire had spread along gas lines and was headed their way. They were forced to evacuate, taking only his dog, his two daugthers and his wife. They took shelter in a local community center, where they were told their house and possessions had been destroyed. Omar did not have time to grab any of his possessions, including important paperwork or clothing. He later drove to his house to see the damage, and it hit him that he now had nowhere to live; his daughters had nowhere to call home anymore. He worked tirelessly for 17 years as a Sushi Chef at a local restaurant in Santa Rosa, and provided the most beautiful life for his two daughters that he could. 

I've known him as a wonderful friend who would help me whenever I needed anything. I worked alongside him as his apprentice and while he taught me everything I know about Sushi, he taught me much more in the way of life. He is a wise, strong man who will go above and beyond for his friends. After I heard about what happend to him, I immediately got in contact with him; I could tell he was feeling helpless, but he did not let me know. He did not want me to worry about him. That is how he is. Throughout my friendship with him, I have found myself in times of hardship; I lost my grandfather in July, and Omar offered to buy me a plane ticket back home so I could attend his funeral, he has stayed up with me talking at night when I just needed a friend and he has taken care of me when I was sick. 

He considers everyone that is close to him to be family, and does whatever he can to show he loves us. Now it is my chance to do what I can to show him how much I love him and appreciate everything he has done with me. He will not be able to return to the restaurant he works at because he needs to take care of his daughters in this time of need, so I am asking for donation money to help him with whatever he may need in these hard times. I am estimating that $20,000 would at least get him standing on his feet (food, water, clothing and money to rebuild his life in a new home). Any small amount will make a difference, as I have learned through his small acts of kindess. Thank you, we appreciate it!

I have had her initial needs met (antibiotics and some iv fluids) at a cost of 300$ (records are available upon request). 

As her eye is not healing I have the unenviable task of finding help for my baby in getting her eye removed but as I am disabled and living on very little money it makes this a very daunting, near impossible task.  I am surviving on ramen and beans to help save my own money to pay (and repay those who contributed to her initial medical bills). 

My other rescues Syd and Joe have taken to her like a duck to water, and we would very much like to see her whole again. She brings a light and love to this house that has been sorely missing. She and her brother love to spend days together cuddling and grooming each other

She has found her way into our hearts in a very short time and I am taking it upon myself to make sure she is healed and happy, but I can't do that without your help.

I have consulted with a veterinarian regarding enucleation and have been given an estimate of costs; please note that the total does include her previous medical visit.

 https://www.nbcnews.com/video/drone-video-captures-scale-of-wildfire-devastation-1069662787527  

On the evening of October 9, 2017, Ben went to sleep in his house with the California wildfires burning more than 45 miles away.  Unfortunately, high winds pushed the fires to Ben's neighborhood while he slept.  When the power at his house went out, Ben awoke, saw the fire warnings on the news on his phone, and escaped with his cat.  Ben was able to warn his nearby neighbors before leaving the area and we are all thankful that he was able to make it out of the neighborhood alive - as we recognize that many people lost their lives or remain missing.

 For those of you who personally know Ben, you know that he is a true friend, a dedicated Tribal leader, has a heart of gold, and is always finding ways to help others.  Now it's our turn to help Ben.  We have created this Go Fund Me account to assist Ben with getting back on his feet - he has lost his home and all of his worldly possessions.  The funds collected through this fundraising campaign will be used to help Ben start over by finding a new home and purchasing basic necessities, such as clothing and household goods.  Any and all donations are greatly appreciated as we want to do everything we can to help Ben recover from this tragedy.

Last year,  I opened gofundme campaign, the cause of raising awareness and donations for the North Bay fire victims and we collectively raised $3600 and donated that to the Redwood Empire Food Bank in Santa Rosa. This summer again, I distributed flyers regarding the help for the victims of the raging Carr fire and we helped the victims with almost $1500 raised. 

Today, I come again with a cause of raising awareness for the victims of the most destructive wildfire in California history, the Camp fire. The brutal California wildfires at both ends of the state are causing major destruction and taking lives. The Camp Fire has become the deadliest in the state's history. It's also the most destructive based on the number of structures destroyed. It has already torched more than 121,000 acres. The Woolsey Fire in Malibu and surrounding areas has scorched 98,362 acres and destroyed hundreds of structures, including celebrity homes. 

To continue my mission of helping natural disaster victims, my non-profit organization, We4U, has taken charge in aiding the victims of the fire. We truly believe our community should support these victims once again to offer our prayers to those who need it in these trying times. In light of the giving season of Thanksgiving and Christmas, let our communal generosities reflect a positive role to the victims of natural disasters and forward the values of spreading good karma.

“Thank you so much! Paradise is a little retirement community and my entire family lives there. We are okay but we've lost over 20 homes just within my family. As far as my family goes, we have been in Paradise for many years. My dad and mom both were raised in Paradise. Myself and all my cousins were born and raised there. We always lived within a five-minute drive of each other and now we are all scattered and that’s probably one of the hardest parts of the whole ordeal. From a little town that nobody knew of to making national news, its weird adjusting. So again, really anything helps. Even school donations. My parents and all my cousins and siblings went to the same elementary school and my mom’s worked there for the last 29 years burnt to the ground. My dad works for the school district and he spent the entire time running around town (literally running on foot because his truck burnt) to evacuate all the students.”

We have an immediate need for your support, and we would appreciate every dollar you can spare. Your donation will be used to obtain the resources necessary to conduct emergency evacuations and extractions of both human beings and animals trapped amidst this catastrophic storm. Funds will also be used to provide food, water, and medical support to the victims of Hurricane Florence. 

Having witnessed immense human suffering firsthand as a war photographer, Burke Bryant discovered that there was an incredible need for immediate humanitarian support in areas experiencing war, famine, disease, and natural disasters. In 2010, he established HARP to answer this pressing need. 

HARP is a global emergency response team tasked with two primary missions: rapid deployment of critical aid to remote areas experiencing war, famine, ethnic cleansing, and natural disasters, and ongoing dedication to those affected until all are upright once again. Initially, HARP worked to provide aid in the form of medical support, water, and food supplies. The organization quickly acquired a global following of dedicated individuals set on bringing relief to those experiencing the most horrific circumstances. 

In 2013, HARP took on natural disaster response. Working as first responders, the team was called in to Moore, Oklahoma, which had been devastated by an EF5 tornado. Bryant and his team of volunteers found themselves directly in the center of the next two storms to hit Oklahoma that week. Throughout this prolonged disaster, HARP saved a great deal of lives, rescuing those who had been caught in the flash floods, swept away in their vehicles, or trapped in their homes. Our success rate was 100% with zero casualties, and from that point forward, emergency response became one of HARP's main priorities.

HARP has since provided aid, medical support, search and recovery (humans & animals), asset extractions, and private security in South Sudan, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Chad, Haiti, Puerto Rico, and home in the USA. As first responders, we have been on the frontline of natural disasters including Oklahoma’s EF5 tornados, Hurricane Matthew, Tropical Storm Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and the California Wildfires.

As for us - my partner, Erika Layman and myself, Haley Camille Freedman, are both Development Coordinators and Fundraising Volunteers for HARP. As our team is out there, we will be gathering immediate emergency funding to be spent on supplies such as food, water, medical and emergency evaluations and extractions. 

Your help and support is not only greatly appreciated at this time, but truly extremely needed. Not by the HARP team, but by both the victims and future victims of this treterous storm that will hurt, take and damage the lives of many. The storm is only getting bigger and more dangerous by the second and our goal is to save as many lives as possible. 

We appreciate all of the donations, help and support that we can get in doing so at this time. Every penny counts when it comes to these things! If you are not in a place financially to donate, please help us by spreading the word of this page. 

Thank you in advance. Please feel free to reach out to us directly with comments, questions and/or concerns.

The wildfires in California have caused massive devastation leaving many displaced with no homes food or belongings. Obviously monetary donations are a great way to help because then responders can purchase what’s actually needed at the time and get those supplies to people. 

       However real people are still very much in need on the ground and they currently need more hands coordinating and delivering care and supplies. Especially with Thanksgiving next week. Many roads are 
closed or blocked and obviously California gets very congested so delivering needed supplies to hard to reach areas is perfect on a motorcycle. For this reason I am leaving for California this Friday the 11-16 until Wednesday 11-21 to assist in the Ventura area with Motorrad Angels and Global Empowerment Mission. Together we will be coordinating with local authorities to get supplies where they are needed most and aid first responders. 

Here is a link to both of their sites.

 https://www.globalempowermentmission.org

Next week is Thanksgiving. Thousands of people have no homes, no clothes, no food or vehicles to get to their jobs so they can rebuild their lives.

A neighbor was ""cooking drugs"" and caused an explosion that led to a fire that destroyed several nearby homes.  The teens and their parents were in bed when it occured and escaped only with what they were wearing.  The home is a total loss as well as all of their belongings and vehicles.

It was a rental home and the landlord has helped with temporary lodging but they need mattresses, furniture, household goods, clothing and shoes. They did not have rental insurance.

Note, just two weeks ago they had to evacuate because of the California wildfires but were spared any damage and now this happened. They need a break.

This Mailbox is All a California Wildfire Left of Their Childhood Home
By Christina Zdanowicz, CNN

Updated 10:13 AM ET, Wed November 14, 2018
 
A mailbox is all that stands of the Bartek home in Paradise, California.
The Bartek family lost more than 30 years of memories as a quickly spreading wildfire burned down their childhood home.
For five days, Phil Bartek and his two adult children wondered if they had been lucky enough to be the last house standing. But on Monday, they found out their home didn't make it and they had photographic proof.
Only the mailbox was left standing at their address in Paradise, California, where their father still lived. The family had called this home since 1985.
""They didn't have time to get anything. My mom's ashes were in the house and they didn't have time to get that,"" Justin Bartek, who lives in Los Angeles, said on Monday.
 

A Lifetime of Memories Gone


 
This is where the Barteks grew up. They fear many of their photos may have been lost in the fire.
When the fire came, Phil Bartek only had enough time to grab his medication, a change of clothes and his cat. Bartek said he only had 15 minutes to vacate his home.
It happened fast, and it was all surreal. He rushed to pick up his granddaughter, Mia, from school. And they managed to save the family's border collie mix, LC.
""The fire moved so quick. There were other people that left after us that were literally driving through fire on both sides of the road,"" the 63-year-old said on Tuesday. ""We were really lucky.""
When Bartek learned his home was gone, he said he was devastated but he was relieved to know. He had been waiting five days to learn what happened.
""I just woke up this morning thinking it's just a bad dream and we're going to go home, but I know that's not going to happen and we're going to have to find a new home,"" Bartek said.

'I Was Hoping I Would be the Last House Standing'

 
Mia Regnier stands in front of the white picket fence at her home.

Aimee Bartek-Regnier, Justin's sister, was also born in Paradise and still lives there. Her father's home is the home she still has a connection to.
""Your childhood home is your home. That's where you feel safe and secure. The place where you can always go back to,"" the 37-year-old said.
Bartek-Regnier, her husband, their 10-year-old daughter Mia and their dog lived a mile from her father. They lived in downtown Paradise.
""I was hoping I would be the last house standing or there would be a pocket of houses standing,"" the baker and grocery store employee said.
She learned the home they had been renting had burned down by seeing the aftermath on social media. Local officials, first responders and others posted images and videos of the homes they saw, along with each location, she said.
""My white picket fence, my trellis, everything you'd identify my house with was gone,"" Bartek-Regnier said. ""We're just waiting on a picture so that we can have our closure that way. I've known since Friday that our house was gone.""
Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said 80% to 90% of homes in residential neighborhoods are gone after the Camp Fire.
""Out of all the people we know in Paradise, we only know one person who still has a house,"" Bartek-Regnier said.

They Want to Stay in Paradise if They Can

Both Bartek-Regnier and her father said they want to stay in Paradise. They know they have no houses to go back to, but this is their home.
""It's hard thinking about starting a new life elsewhere when you don't know anybody. We don't have anything, but we are still in our familiar surroundings,"" Bartek-Regnier said.
Paradise is a beautiful place and a town where everyone knows everyone, she said. She grew up there and so has her daughter, Mia.
""In times of tragedy, people have always come together in Paradise,"" she said.
Her father is not sure what his next move is yet. He knows the chances of rebuilding where his home once was may be difficult.
""We go back and forth from trying to stay in the area or starting a new life in another town or out of state,"" Bartek said. ""It's really a tough call because we've been here for so long.""
Bartek has lived in Paradise since 1979. He and his wife raised their two children there. Bartek worked at supermarket chain Safeway and is now retired.
 
Before and after photos show how wildfire reduced Paradise, California, to ashes
He rebuilt his life after his wife passed away in 2014, he said. He leads a youth ministry group for teens and children at his church. He also helps with the music.
The widower even found love again. Bartek met Susan at their church and they're engaged to be married in February 2019.
Bartek and his fiancée had started moving her furniture into his home and had redecorated the place together. She was set to move in February. Her rental home also burned down in the wildfire, so she's staying with her daughter.
Their wedding rings were lost in the fire, as were many of the centerpieces and other wedding decorations that were at his house.
Their chapel is still standing, but many of the church's buildings were lost. Their caterer's restaurant was also destroyed.
Yet he said the wedding date of February 2 is still set.

""My life's is truly blessed except for the fire and I'm trying to stay optimistic because I have so much to look forward to,"" Bartek said. ""My faith in God is my comfort and resolve to rebuild and rethink the future. Everyone I know feels the same so we're all together in the same boat. It's a damn BIG boat.""",1615,10000,9,9,62,"PARADISE, CA"," November 19, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34666314_1542614433226836_r.jpeg,9,62,9,0.9972,5854,10000,0.1615,0,0,"['path', 'tree', 'trail', 'woodland', 'forest', 'grass']"

I am reaching out on behalf of my sister, Kathleen. She's the one on the right of course. Kathleen is a single, independent, hard-working, compassionate, caring, lover of animals and nature. She also was diagnosed with ovarian cancer just after Christmas 2016.


I created this fund in the hope of helping ease some of the financial burdens Kathleen is facing and to protect against any unforeseen financial setbacks throughout her treatment until, God willing, she fully recovers.

Kathleens condition and ongoing treatment does not allow her to work, and her medical bills from the various doctors, hospital stays, and chemotherapy are mounting. Kathleen's out of pocket co-pay is $6,500 with each chemo treament cost of $120. per visit.  She is blessed to have our parents relatively close by, but they are in their mid-80s with few resources. I share her journey below in the hope you will support her during these difficult times. We greatly appreciate any donation amount. Please continue to stand with us and pray for a speedy recovery.

Kathleen's Story.

Back in August 2016, Kathleen wasn't feeling well. She was suffering from an acute cough and, at the time, she contributed her illness to the smoke from the nearby California wildfires. Her doctors diagnosed her with bronchitis and asthma and prescribed prednisone and antibiotics. But her health did not improve; her cough continued.

On November 11th, she told the doctors at the Family Practice Clinic where she works how bad she was feeling and informed them she needed to take some time off work. By that time, Kathleen had developed a fever and leg muscle pain. The fever continued for an entire month. She finally was able to get the pulmonary issues under control, but the fever persisted; and now she was suffering from extreme fatigue. At that point, she had to stay at our parents’ home.

 Kathleen's doctors could not determine precisely what was wrong with her. They ordered chest x-rays, CT scans of the sinus, and referred her to an infectious disease doctor resulting in multiple blood draws. In December, four months after her initial symptoms, the doctors finally ordered a CT scan of her chest, abdomen and torso. That is when the doctors found what appeared to be a mass on one of her ovaries. They confirmed the mass by pelvic ultrasound.

Kathleen underwent surgery on December 27, 2016. The surgery initially was intended to simply remove the mass, but the initial biopsy indicated ovarian cancer…Stage 3. The doctors called this a secondary finding. The surgeon ended up performing a full hysterectomy and Kathleen stayed in the hospital for five days to recover from the surgery.

Kathleen feels much better now, and has bounced back from the surgery, but the fight isn't over. In some ways, it has just begun. On February 10, 2017, she persevered through the first of what will be four months of weekly chemo treatments to combat the cancer cells and to insure she is completely healed from the disease. The hope, of course, is to have no future recurrence. 

This is where you all come, whether you are a family member, a friend, a co-worker, or a compassionate stranger with a heart of gold. Your generous donation will relieve the stresses of the mounting medical expenses and enable Kathleen to focus on healing.

Once upon a time there was a Boy. A very odd Boy. His head was always in the clouds. He was curious, but not studious. He preferred fantasy novels to schoolbooks. He would rarely if ever do his homework, then ace every test. Teachers were very frustrated with the Boy. The Boy didn’t especially care. The Boy’s parents cared very much, but that’s not germane to this story. The Boy religiously watched professional wrestling, but could quote full scenes from Shakespeare. He would head bang to Metallica, yet secretly loved his mother’s classical music. He practiced with the football and tennis teams after school and on weekends, yet played chess or Dungeons & Dragons during lunch. He was ‘cool’ with the stoners and the gang bangers, yet he wasn’t a part of any particular ‘clique’. He had a few close friends but in general, was uncomfortable around people. Unfortunately, like all teenagers, he felt that no one understood him. 

One day in high school in the idyllic year of 1990, the Boy saw a Girl leave a classroom as he was walking down the hall. He thought to himself that she was very cute. Many years later he would privately admit to her that his first thought seeing her was “nice butt”. She was not upset at this. Later in the week, while chatting with his best Friend at the time, the same girl came up to the two and hugged the Friend. Turned out they had recently started dating. She smiled at the Boy who blushed but smiled back shyly. The Boy was instantly jealous of his friend of course but happy at the same time to make her acquaintance. 

As the school year progressed the two amigos became three. They were thick as thieves. They would too often ditch school to hit the mall, the beach, or the arcade. The Boy felt like a third wheel but enjoyed their company nonetheless. One day the Friend asked him to take care of the Girl. Watch her back as it were. He had apparently made an enemy of a particular segment of the high school population and he was worried they would mess with the Girl because of their relationship. The Boy was bigger than most kids at school and unbeknownst to him, was thought by others to be very intimidating. The quiet kid most likely to gun down the school or something. Another thing learned (and laughed at) years later. 

The Boy said he would make sure to take care of the Girl. He would walk her to and from class, drove her home (days when he had a car). The Friend meanwhile, got an after school job that took up all his free time. The Boy and Girl carried on for months, even after ‘the threat’ was over. They hung out, had a good time, laughed at the same jokes, listened to the same music, and overall were generally goofy with each other. The Boy was very happy. But he recognized there was a problem. He began to fall for his best friend’s girlfriend. 

Midway through the school year, the Boy and the Friend took a drive. They talked about this and that, these and those. Until the Friend mentioned that he’d been seeing another girl on the side. He wasn’t really 'working' all those extra hours he told the Girl about. The Boy was very upset. He felt that the Girl should know. He told the Friend that it was a jerk move to sneak around. But the Friend wanted to juggle both. The Boy was torn. He wanted to do the right thing and tell the Girl, but he was a loyal friend. He reluctantly kept the secret. It turned out to be a moot issue shortly thereafter anyway. The Friend had a big mouth and told the wrong people about his dalliance. Rumors started to get back to the Girl. 

Soon after, she and the Friend got into a knock down drag out fight over the phone and she called the Boy to come over. She was worried. The Friend apparently had a temper that the Boy was unaware of.  There were never any playful confrontations or genial arm-punching between them. Perhaps because the Boy was twice the size of the Friend and would beat him stupid. So the Boy came over and comforted the Girl. And when the Friend came over to ‘talk things out’ with the Girl, the Boy strongly insinuated the Friend should leave. He did.

Later in the week, the Boy and the Girl were talking on the phone late at night. She wondered what she should do about her situation. On one hand she thought maybe she should give the Friend another chance. But she was hesitant. When the Boy pressed the issue, she admitted she had feelings for someone else. She asked the Boy’s opinion on what she should do. The Boy told her that he couldn’t be impartial. She asked why. A million things went on in the Boy’s head. The scenario of the next few moments played over and over in a rapid fire series of probabilities. 

In the end, the Boy finally admitted that he had feelings for the Girl. After a few moments of stunned silence, they talked. And the Boy felt his heart soar for the first time in his life when she revealed her feelings for another were actually for HIM. This was what the poems spoke about. What the songs sang about. This is what people go through their life trying to find. All this.. interrupted by the Boy’s father knocking on his door saying “Go to bed, it’s after midnight!”

The next day the epic romance began. As much as young love can BE an epic romance that is. Time began to fly. Soon it was the summer. The two were inseparable. Words can’t properly convey the emotions they both felt. However after a year, the Boy’s father retired and the family had to move to 'the cold state'. The Boy and Girl were crushed. Though they both vowed to make the long distance relationship last, they were keenly aware the odds were against it. Nevertheless when the Boy settled in to the new home, he made it his mission to get back to the Girl. And gigantic long distance phone charges (for his parents) began to accrue. He worked two jobs after school, scrimping and saving his pennies. While he was gone though, the Girl had to move as well. Her parents had divorced and she was being forced to live with her mother in 'the hot state'. Long distance charges continued to accumulate. After 9 months, when he felt like he had a suitable sum, the Boy packed up his car and drove to be with the Girl. There was much rejoicing.

The two of them moved into a small studio apartment. It was furnished and utilities paid. Two things that a couple starting out really appreciated. 6 months later, the Girl found out her dad had a heart attack. And while in the hospital, 3 days later had a stroke. Being the dutiful daughter she was, she volunteered to move back to help take care of him. The Boy was once again alone. When it looked like she wasn’t coming back anytime soon, he fell into a deep depression. He soon lost his job and had to move back in with his parents in the cold state. Noting how miserable he was, his parents recommended he go help the Girl out in taking care of her father. With a renewed spirit he did so. They got the father’s affairs in order and together they moved with him back to the hot state where the Girl’s other siblings all lived. They thought her father needed all the love and support he could get.

They had some hardships along the way. Her father required constant care including assistance with the bathroom and shower. But they had each other. After a time, her father passed away. They were both devastated. He’d been with them for several years at this point. But they still had each other. And cats. They always had cats. Seasons changed, years went by. There were times of joy, times of sadness, and lots of times where nothing at all happened of any note. Some might say their life was boring, but they were boring together. And this is what matters. 

They grew older. And they bought a house. They were thrilled after renting for the previous 20 years. Unfortunately soon after, the Boy got very sick. He was hours away from death the doctors said. In fact, he learned later, he had technically died on the table briefly. But the Boy had something to live for. Despite being hospitalized for two weeks with multiple surgeries and several drug-addled panic attacks, he finally made it home to the Girl. He needed help with a lot of things over the next year. The Girl did all of those things without complaint. Ok maybe a little complaint, but the Boy didn’t blame her. And being home with her kept the black thoughts out of his mind. Kept him from giving up. They had been together for more years than they had years apart at this point. They were not two people anymore. They had evolved into one co-dependent organism. And with all of her love, help, and support, the Boy got better.

The Girl however, got worse. She had had ‘feminine issues’ her whole life. And they had gotten progressively worse over the years. Once the Boy had returned to normal life, the Girl decided to finally get herself looked at. She saw a doctor who ran some tests. The next day, a Saturday, the lab called and told her to go to the emergency room for a blood transfusion. She had alarmingly low levels of hemoglobin. Mind you, she had been living with anemia for a while, taking iron supplements, etc. So while they thought it was nothing alarming, the two of them went to the hospital. They kept her overnight, gave her multiple intrusive tests, two pints of blood, and told her they would send the results to her doctor in a few days. 

The tests came back. Endometrial Cancer. Cancer of the uterus. 

The Boy and Girl were devastated. There was more testing to be done, to determine severity and a course of action, but no matter what brave faces one could put on it, the news was terrifying. The Girl is tough (even if she doesn’t think she is) and the Boy is stubborn. They were determined to get through this. 

The doctors were confident it was contained in her uterus so they soon performed a full hysterectomy. The Boy watched her wheeled down the hall, making sure to put on his bravest face for her. Only when the gurney turned the corner did he allow emotions to overtake him. Several agonizing hours later, the surgery was complete and he was able to see her in the recovery room.  She was sedated but she was alive. And the Boy let out a sigh of relief and a prayer of thanks. Her hospital stay was one of the longest weeks of his life.

It was discovered during the surgery that the cancer had spread to one set of lymph nodes which they also removed. Because of that, her cancer was re-classified from stage 2 to 3. Soon after she began her chemo. She took it like a champ. And credit to her doctors on being the kindest, most patient professionals you could possibly want when dealing with something so scary. After the 2nd round of chemo, she started losing her hair. She and her sisters turned her head shaving into an event. A fun moment instead of a humiliating inevitability. The girl bought some wigs though and had been playing dress up with her sisters. She's always been beautiful to the Boy, but you could see how important it was to be beautiful to herself. And this again, is how it should be. 

Life resumed. The Boy got called in to work on a particularly busy day. He texted with the Girl during the day and nothing appeared out of the ordinary. When he got home from work, he heard a noise coming from the bedroom. The girl had her eyes tightly shut and her hands, clenched into fists against her chest. He thought it was a bad dream so he tried shaking her awake. After a few moments he realized she was having a massive seizure.  He called 911 and they kept him calm until help arrived. He did manage cover her up at least (it was a hot day plus she had frequent hot flashes due to forced menopause).

So the ambulance took her to a  local hospital. Although the Boy wasn't allowed to ride with her, he followed them (as soon as he found their hiding cats).  The doctors were not encouraging. In hindsight, they were being realistic but all the Boy heard was ""possible aneurysm, stroke, brain tumor"". They put her into a medically induced coma to stop the seizing. But it all faded in the background as the Boy whispered in her ear to come back to him. 

The Girl was moved to another hospital hours later (for insurance or care reasons, no one ever said). The Boy rushed there as well but there wasn’t much to do beside wait. Even though the seizure had ended, the newer scare was her temperature. It had managed to rise to 104 degrees. They literally covered her with ice packs and put her on a cooling blanket . They did a ton of tests. Tests were still going on when the Boy fell asleep on an uncomfortable little couch in the room. 

 Finally The doctors were able to give her a diagnosis of a somewhat rare condition caused by the 'perfect storm' of circumstances. Her chemotherapy reduced her white blood count, which meant her immune system was radically diminished. She must have picked up the flu other bug while shopping in days prior. Add in slightly elevated blood pressure, stress, and a bit of exertion, and her brain shut down.  A syndrome called P.R.E.S. Fortunately the R stood for 'reversible',  but it took days for the Girl to be able to communicate. The first positive sign came after a couple of days when the Boy cracked  a joke and the Girl weakly raised her hand... and flipped him off. 

The Girl remained in the hospital for a full week, family always at her side until it was finally time for the Boy to bring her home. Together again, they face an uncertain future. Will there be more medical emergencies? The chemo still has a couple more sessions to go, what then? She'll need follow up testing, MRI's, etc. The Boy has insurance but the medical bills keep piling up.  A large deductible and 20% co-insurance leaves a lot owed to a lot of people.

The Boy was raised to pay his debts. And he swore many years ago to always take care of his Girl. He does not want to ask for help, but would be grateful and blessed with any he can get.

Not all stories are happy ones. But until next time, hug your loved ones close boys and girls.  No matter what happens. The Boy and Girl will get through this. But that’s a story, among hopefully many others, for another day…

Tens of thousands of children, including our own five children, have been touched by his ministry, called We Kids.  You can find him online at wekids.org. We have not only listened to him on the radio for nearly 20 years, but he has corresponded with our children by email and letters and been an encouragement to us in our walk with Jesus. He is also one of our beloved prayer partners for our own ministry called Doulos Missions International.

On November 8, 2018, a wildfire known as Camp Fire destroyed his home town of Paradise, CA. It was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California's history, claiming at least 84 lives and destroying 19,000 structures, including 9.700 homes, among those being Mr. Nick's own home. But by the grace of God, he escaped alive! We want to help him rebuild and get back on his feet so he can continue serving the Lord in his ministry.

You have to see the videos (like the one below) to really grasp the magnitude of the devastation. 


Here is a video of Ken being interviewed by KRON4 News  after he escaped from Paradise and took shelter at a Red Cross evacuation center in Oroville. 

Won't you consider giving a gift to help Mr. Nick? Any amount small or great will be appreciated.  Jesus said, ""Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of Mine, you did for Me."" (Mt 25:40, NIV). 

He will be withdrawing the funds directly to his own personal bank account, in order to cover his emergency living expenses, the rebuilding of his home and radio studio, including replacing his music recordings, sound equipment, and any other losses he has incurred. If there is any money left over, he will donate it to We Kids Radio, a non-profit charity, and/or use it to help others in his community who have also suffered the loss of their homes.

This devastation comes less than one year after Darwin’s exoneration from a 1991 wrongful conviction.  Darwin  spent 27 years wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit.  Darwin was exonerated in January of this year and the DA issued a public apology to him, but he is ineligible for compensation because of a technicality.   But even without any support from the State or society, Darwin had rebuilt his life, earned a job, bought a home, and was busy supporting himself and his family when their home and all their belongings burned to the ground.  

The deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history, known as the Camp Fire, swept through their Paradise over the last two weeks, reducing the town and everything Darwin owned to ashes and rubble.

Darwin's home after the Camp Fire swept through Paradise.


Details on fire:

- Location, Butte County
- 153,336 acres burned
- 70 percent contained
- 88 fatalities confirmed
- 203 people unaccounted for
- 17,148 structures destroyed (12,947 residences, 483 commercial and 3,718 other buildings)


Details on Darwin's exoneration:

In 1991, Darwin Crabtree, who had never been in trouble before, was wrongfully convicted of molesting his two sons.  The boys, who were 7 and 11 at the time, had been placed in the care of an unlicensed therapist during their parents’ tumultuous divorce.  Over months of sessions, the therapist-in-training convinced them that their father had touched them improperly.  The boys’ false statements were the only evidence against Darwin.

When the boys became adults, they told everyone who would listen to them that their father was innocent and had never touched them in a sexual way.  They eventually reunited with Darwin in a meeting filled with hugs and tears as Darwin assured them that it was not their fault and he had never blamed them.  The boys--now men--signed statements swearing to their father’s innocence, but by then, Darwin had been tried, convicted, served nearly 9 years in prison, and completed his 3 years of parole.   At the time, California law did not provide a mechanism for someone in Darwin’s position (no longer incarcerated or on parole) to challenge their conviction, so Darwin remained wrongfully convicted and continued to have to live as a ""registered sex offender,"" subject to the stigma associated with that status.

In 2017, CA law finally changed to allow people like Darwin who obtained newly discovered evidence of innocence after their release to challenge their wrongful convictions.  With the help of the Northern California Innocence Project, Darwin filed a motion to vacate his conviction.  

The District Attorney investigated the case, agreed that Darwin is innocent and that his conviction should be reversed, and then dismissed the charges against him.  

On January 17, 2018, Darwin was officially exonerated and recognized to be the innocent man he has always been.  The DA apologized to Darwin, and to his sons, but that apology was all that Darwin got for his nearly 27 years of wrongful conviction.  


Darwin, his mother (who always believed in him), and his two sons, outside the courthouse on the day of Darwin's exoneration.


Despite suffering for 27 years under a wrongful conviction, Darwin has not received one cent of compensation.  Yet even with the stigma he has lived under and the way the system has failed him repeatedly, Darwin managed to become a productive member of society after his release from prison.  He earns his living as a contractor and supports himself, his wife Sandi, and their family through his work.  

Before his name was cleared, there were many setbacks, like when people would learn about his status and put flyers up with his picture labeling him a sex offender.   But in January of this year, it looked like things were finally starting to right themselves.   Following his exoneration, he would never again have to go to the police station on his birthday to ""register.""  His name and photograph would no longer show up online with some of the worst criminals in the state.  He could get jobs that were unavailable to him while the system still had a red letter by his name.

But then tragedy struck again.  Just ten months after his exoneration, the most destructive wildfire in CA history burned down everything Darwin had earned in his attempts to put his life back together.  Not only did everything burn but they have also learned their insurance will not cover much.  He and Sandi had moved into a mobile home after one of the times Darwin lost work because of his status, and placed their larger possessions in storage. They had homeowner’s insurance, but have learned that because they had moved into a mobile home, only the exterior was covered and not their belongings.  Worse still, they learned their storage unit is only covered for up to $1000, even though it was filled with furniture, a washer and dryer, a television, and all sorts of precious belongings.  Some of the things they lost are irreplaceable, like the photographs from when his children were young and family heirlooms he had inherited, but others, like couches, electronics, the motorcycle that he used for escape, can be replaced with money.  And that's where we come in.

Darwin suffered for 27 years of wrongful conviction and has received nothing from society.  Now we have a chance to step up and help him when he needs it most.  He and his family lost everything in the fire.  Your gift will help Darwin and his family begin to rebuild their lives amidst this devastation.

As you can see from his short video, throughout everything, Darwin always finds something to smile about, even when it's through well-deserved tears.  Please take this opportunity to help someone who has always helped himself and who could not be more deserving of your help.",3495,25000,14,15,112,"PARADISE, CA"," November 26, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34865114_1543270140911966_r.jpeg,15,112,14,0.9622,6004,25000,0.1398,0,0,['senior citizen']

Here are quiet heroes who are desperately in need of help. Robi and Bob Carmack, my husband’s sister and her sweet family.

Robi and Bob have fostered over 100 children. Crack babies, children in wheelchairs, each and every kind of handicapped child you can imagine. They are just average, hardworking people. Yet somehow over the past 20 years they have managed to help all of these kids and have adopted seven of their own. Quietly, on their own, they just got it done. Until two days ago…

This family barely escaped the California wildfire you may have been reading about. They left their home just in time, with only the shirts on their back and these special kids. It’s 39 degrees where they are staying and all they have are the shorts and tee shirts they were forced to leave in. No coats, no boots, no clothes. Nothing. 

These are not wealthy people. These are not people who gain from their great charitable work. They are not people who complain. They are not people who want anything for what they do. They are just people with big hearts and who love kids.

This is as real as it gets. I know them and am trying to help. Its a horrible situation. So I am asking you to repost this page and give anything you can. Even a dollar will help.

If we can’t help them, I can’t imagine how they can ever get back on their feet again and continue to help these children. I don’t know what will happen. Who plans on losing everything in the blink of an eye to a horrendous fire?

There are just no words. Please let’s help them regain the life they made helping these kids.  

Please consider donating to this wonderful family and giving back a little of what they have given so freely for 20 years. They have been true angels and now we need to to find that angel inside of us for them. Thank you so much!

Our hearts are with everyone who has been affected by the destruction, people who have lost their lives, and have lost their homes and their business. 

Upon evacuating from my family’s Vineyard and home in Napa ( www.segassiavineyard.com), we've returned to find that we lost everything. As a vintner on the Segassia Vineyard, we also found that our vineyard was utterly destroyed. 

And it’s not just us….

According to wine industry insiders, there are millions of dollars of unharvested wine grapes still hanging on the vines in Napa and Sonoma, as many winemakers and vineyard owners were not allowed access back to their properties during the fire to harvest the grapes. 

While the grapes are not harvestable for wine, they can still be harvested to make Wine RayZyns. My family and I have a plan to take these grapes and help out our community. 

We at The Wine RayZyn Company have partnered with Food Recovery Network to take unharvested wine grapes from vineyards affected and turn them into Wine RayZyns. We intend to take the shelf-stable RayZyns with a 2+ year shelf life to help feed victims of other natural disasters like the hurricane victims in Puerto Rico and the victims of the California fires. We are calling these Wine RayZyns, “Rescue RayZyns.” 

This California Fire Rescue RayZyn project is a way for us to repurpose the fallout of this major disaster in order to provide direct benefit to those affected and currently suffering. 
 
In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of “Rescue RayZyns TM” will be used to benefit Napa, Sonoma and Santa Rosa Fire efforts. This partnership will allow food distribution companies, retailers, wineries and vineyard owners the opportunity to join forces and make a real and immediate impact to those victims who have recently been affected. 

Our goal is to raise $500,000 to fund the costs associated with processing and distributing the Rescue RayZyns TM. We hope you can join us in rebuilding our community and feeding victims affected by the wildfires as well as the hurricanes in Puerto Rico.

I CREATED MY PHOTO-ART IMAGE STYLE WORKING ON HURRICANE SANDY. THEN HURRICANE FLORENCE RAN INTO ME HEAD-FIRST.  I’M NOW CRAZY

Caution: If you do not like creative art and photography, read this at your own risk.

I was working on a photo-art-collage series on faces (& dogs) –  à la Picasso and others. Now, having been caught in Hurricane Florence I’m forced to add the faces, the images of Climate Change survivors – like you’ve never seen before.

Why do I care about being funded? THE REAL REASON:  CRAZY is not a simple saying. Surviving Hurricane Florence demonstrated what has to be done. I was threatened! Mental and Physical Survival Is Not A Compromise.

 It will help others understand this.

I HAVE TO INTERJECT A NOTE HERE: As a former film producer, aside from the usual commercial, industrial products, I covered disaster chemical and oil spills, floods, and a nuclear accident. It was part of what I did for the US EPA and others. But this is Climate Change disaster that affects all of us. I have never had to explain this visually before. #NOTE END 

 PART 1: Hurricane Florence DESTROYED 100’S of photo images I did for my Face and Dog (Dog-Face) photo art series. (Do you recall Picasso face sketches and painting?) This is different in the sense it also involves Climate Change Disaster survivors. How it happened: It started while images were being transferred from my camera to the computer. The series is a part of original work I will accomplish in a way no one else has.  THIS WORK MUST BE IN ART GALLERIES!  Help fund me, or buy my work. I’ll use proceeds to accomplish the subject and gallery plan. There are two ways. it might be helpful if you visit my website  www.carlbistrack.com But by comparison to what I will accomplish, they are the TAME version.

THE REAL PART: CRAZY!  You think that came out of nowhere?

A sudden power surge; computer and camera were jolted; then the reverse – power went out. That was a sudden result, but it goes on…. Hurricane Florence knocked down houses next to me, or blew them sideways. The wind caused trees to uproot and literally split houses apart. The ground was so completely soaked the water couldn’t drain. Elevation didn’t matter. The area was like an overflowed bathtub with no way to shut off the spigot. I was next door to that! If hit, I would have no way to recover – no place to live. My food spoiled. Can’t buy food, Can’t travel. Stores were closed. Gas stations closed. They couldn’t get deliveries – food or gas. All my work was trashed. Have you ever stood in line to get food; maybe at the school cafeteria. Remember that? Try doing it now as the result of a hurricane or other calamity. You think a news story corrects that situation. You think Trump would solve the problem? – maybe if he could make money on it.

CRAZY is the real deal. Maybe I can describe what I will accomplish in a logical, reasonable way, and I’ll try to do that, but in this case, Crazy is the real deal. I will produce work others have not done. I can accomplish what will stand alongside Picasso, Miro, and Dali. Crazy is a demonic, wild aggression that WILL accomplish. My website  www.carlistrack.com will give you a clue. NO work seen is a simple straightforward photograph. It’s a beginning by comparison --- It’s a TAMER version.  I have to do it now – like-it-or-not.

There’s a second part of CRAZY and producing the face-dog series I haven’t mentioned, possibly because of anger, sadness, and challenge stages. The series, in part, is adding  the Calamity Face of a Hurricane, Fire, Flood… No, it’s not the faces of horror, but will be portrayed as a challenge and rebuilding attitude. The title may say it, but the face will show it even more. Not a victim of war. Not sad, not beaten, but a weather-proof image as a Picasso or other artist has never completed. There’s a new era of climate change that’s increasing.  I can and will show a change in attitude.  It’s not a simple smile or a sneer, but an attitude you don’t normally see.

In 2018 alone over 1 million persons have evacuated their homes and living areas. ONE MILLION Can you imagine that many people having to instantly drive away from the houses and life they built – or YOU built.

500,000 properties – Hurricane Florence NC, SC, VA. 250,000 properties California wildfires, more in the Florida Panhandle. How many persons in New Orleans, New Jersey, New York, and Florida before?

How to portray loss of accustomed  living? We’re going through a security and attitude change.

 A REASONABLE EXPLANATION:

I WANT TO GET THIS WORK INTO ART GALLERIES --- BUT THERE’S A SLIGHT HITCH  

Everybody likes Photography. Everybody likes Art. Galleries like one or the other, but they‘re taken by surprise by my media mixes combining the two – which is rare. My work is the combination of photo and art. Good stuff is good stuff - shouldn’t matter. I can prove that. A beginning - My work is in a few galleries.

What happened and why I’m looking for funding

WHAT STARTED ME DOING THIS: - IT’S A COMBINATION OF HURRICANES

Working on my piece HALLOWEEN HURRICANE SANDY 2012 is the basis of my developing my Photo-Art-Collage style. (won 6th  place  out of 707 entries – Maryland Federation of Art) 

And then, as if coincidence, HURRICANE FLORENCE, September 14, 2018.  But, this time, I wasn’t working on a hurricanes subject.  I was transferring camera images that took me few weeks to photo of persons faces and dogs, from my camera to a Photoshop image program on my computer, and then it happened: I was working on this the night the hurricane hit. I heard several gunshot-like explosions, and a BANG. The lights blinked. A lightning-like flash and THE POWER WENT OUT!  The lights, the computer, the camera images transfer – everything stopped. There was a bright flash then everything went dark. And second, I LOST ALL IMAGES I WAS TRANSFERRING ONTO MY COMPUTER. I learned about it 10 days later when the power came back on. I don’t even want to talk about what it’s like being without electricity – no lighting, losing the food in the fridge and freezer, all going bad, searching for canned food and other in a 10+ day period, summer heat and high humidity. At least I had water. This was all in 90 degree weather. Oh, and I forgot, the water soaked, not drainable ground soil incubated nearly Chihuahua size mosquitoes (wasp size actually) they bit everything they could find.

I’m now again back to the starting point. I have to photograph new parts for my Dog-Face series that I couldn’t review because of the hurricane power issue. I intended to create a unique series plus my existing work to introduce these to art galleries. All piece are on canvas. They would have a choice of a free Photo-Art-Collage they can sell in their gallery. In other words, they accept my one free art piece. They sell at their price and retain 100%. I do not get paid. That lets them see the viewer interest and put the value in perspective. If I get this work into 12-16 galleries initially, likely 4-6 will take on my work. All the galleries will likely sell my work to their benefit. My photo-art-collage medium will become accepted. A new series of facial Climate Change images will impact the medium.

I should let you know what the Dog-Face series will be. I enjoy what I do. You may recall some of Picasso’s face and figure pieces and sketches. Mine will be every bit as enjoyable and unique in a way you’ve not really seen before. I’ve already set myself up mentally. I know what I have to do. How to get there? What it will cost?

To put it briefly – photograph – edit/create Dog-Face series – find galleries – email select galleries – get their choices – make canvas prints – travel to gallery – they make selection – repeated press releases to enhance interest. Galleries get excited I hope.

THE DETAILS:

TWO – THREE WEEKS
 --- Photograph numerous faces. I intend using a number of different face parts. The completed FACES will be unique individuals comprised of many parts.  We are all unique.
--- Photograph a number different dog breeds – l will be using various dog parts to produce the individual
Note: I originally photographed faces at random over several months. I would now want to photograph them in a concentrated period of time.
4-6 WEEKS --- Produce the Face and Dogs series
ONE WEEK --- Email selected galleries in cities and let them know of my offer – I would bring in 3 of my pieces for their selection at no cost to them.  They can sell the piece and retain 100% of the proceeds. In this way they can see the value of my work for the viewer/customer and their business perspective.
ONE WEEK  --- Print the range of pieces on canvas for their selection of the one piece. NOTE: When I email the images of the 4-6 pieces, they will determine which subjects are more appropriate for their buyers. In this way, I will see what images are more likely popular and narrow the number of printed pieces down to roughly-3 pieces for each gallery presentation. (actually less)  Viewing an image in an email is one way to see if It’s liked or not, but seeing it in person may change their perception. In this presentation way, they are more sure of the selected image. Also this lets me know if a subject matter and style may be preferred by most if not all the galleries. It will help my business observation.
The emails should take about a week to find which galleries can be visited. I can then set up a travel schedule.
THREE WEEKS - TRAVEL SCHEDULE
t’s intended I drive one circle route at a time. The travel route– example – will start from Wilmington, NC driving to Charleston SC, to Atlanta, GA, to Charlotte, NC, to Winston-Salem Greensboro,  Raleigh/Durham , and back to Wilmington. There are 3 circle routes tentatively planned. The farthest route  being New York City. Each route should take about 3 days and require a 1-2 day recovery and business information recording

HERE’S THE ALTERNATIVE                          $5,827
- I do it more simply – no gallery travel $4,000.
–  Complete the photo-art-college Dog-Face series 2 months
–  Send repeated emails to galleries
–  Repeated Press releases to selected geographic areas
I expect this is stretched over a longer period of time, but will work almost as well.
Financial differences: No free gallery samples – may have to produce one-at-a-time. No travel personalization viewing.

GoFundMe benefit
My work will be enjoyable to see – UNIQUE and creative. The website will give you a clue  www.carlbistrack.com  (TAME by comparison as I mentioned. If I did this effort normally, over a period of time, it would minimally take over a year to complete. Concentrating my time on producing and completing the series would be the most productive and creative  period forcing my thinking and fitting into a total blueprint - one part built upon another and another.

How can I thank you for any donation? When the Dog-Face series is completed it will be posted on my website. I can’t calculate costs or available sizes or styles, but I will guarantee that if interested in anything on the site, your cost would be reduced by as much as I possibly can in appreciation.  I’d like to make it your benefit as well.  

Why do I care about being funded? THE REAL REASON:  CRAZY is not a simple saying. Surviving Hurricane Florence demonstrated what has to be done. I was threatened! Mental and Physical Survival Is Not A Compromise.

 It will help others understand this.

It’s a devastating time for so many families. My boyfriend of 4 years and his father just lost their home in Agoura Hills. His father, Robert, escaped with the clothes on his back, while my boyfriend Jake, who was out of state for work, was 1,700 miles from home and not able to save a single thing, including his car. Their home was completely leveled. All their most precious photos, keepsakes, and memories are lost. The only thing that matters is that no one was hurt, and their lives were spared.










Which brings me to why I’m reaching out. As a lot of you know, Jake is an incredibly talented musician/producer/filmmaker. For the past three and a half months, Jake and his dad restored and renovated Jake’s home recording studio with their own hands. It was finally the highly professional and functioning studio he’d always needed. He barely had a week to enjoy the finished product before leaving for his job in Texas.










Film making and music are Jake’s life, passion, and sole source of income. Every piece of recording equipment was destroyed, as well as his entire film production set up. Each piece collected over a lifetime. Certain things like vintage amps may be impossible to replace, but I want to do everything in my power to get him back on his feet, and back to creating the art that means so much to him and so many people.







I am reaching out because they are the kind of people who do not ask for help. They are the first to help others. The most generous souls I’ve ever met. They now have to start completely over. I created this fundraiser because I know they would never ask anything of anyone. There are so many people who love and support them who've been asking how they can help. If you're able to give anything, I know how deeply appreciated it would be, and if not please considering sharing this link to help spread the word. Thank you so much for reading. Love to you and your families.

Just like limiting ozone depleting substances made a huge difference with the ozone holes over the poles
that started back in the 80's with certain Styrofoam packages and certain aerosols with the Montreal Protocol
curbing pollution and such.

We will plant the same amount of evergreen trees as funds donated up to certain level of funds raised.

My 75 year old mother lives in Lucerne, a small sweet community on the north shore of Clear Lake. On Wednesday August 3rd the Fire was not near her and there was no evacuation in order. But by Friday August 6th the fire had exploded in size and she was woken up by the sheriffs department yelling from bullhorns “This is the sheriffs department. There is a mandatory evacuation! GET OUT IMMEDIATELY!!” — she lives alone in a small but darling mobile home in a quiet senior complex. She refused to leave at first because she had no gas in her car but with the help of her niece she got gas but then fell trying to get out, cracking a rib. She then had to drive twenty plus miles away to an evacuation center where she had to sleep outside in a tent. Even though the Red Cross did an amazing job giving her support and food a tent with one blanket for her and her 15 year old dog weren’t going to work. Plus the nights were cold and the days have been hot and Smokey and she’s trying to recover from the cracked rib.) I came to help but when we drove to Reno to stay with family we realized she could not stay there (five big dogs and small home under construction and there was worry about her little old dog with the big dogs and her falling) — a decision was made to put her in a hotel till repopulation of her town happens (which is still not known). We still do not know if she even has a home to go home to. She (and I ) are on a very limited income and the hotel was expensive along with the fact we had to buy clothes and dog food and toiletries and gas (she left in such a hurry she only grabbed one or two outfits and only one pair of shoes. I will travel back to Reno Saturday to bring her back home hopefully the evacuation will be lifted and hopefully she has a home. I’m trying to raise money to help with getting her clothes and food (she’s hungry and only weighs 85 lbs was recently diagnosed with cancer) and recovering from the cost of the hotel and help with her medicine from her injury and help with anything she may need in case her home was lost to the fire. Please help. Any amount would be appreciated. Much love. Thank you.

On Sunday night Oct 8th he was evacuated due to the wildfires barely making it out before his mobile home set on fire. He is now displaced and concerned about his future. Diego is concerned that he will not find a place to live with his retirement salary and being 78 he thinks finding work would be extremely difficult. Diego lost everything...fleeing from the fire he ran out with what was on his back and wallet. Any sort of donation would be greatly appreciated. Diego needs housing, clothing, food and most importantly he needs money to get back on his feet. Please help Diego find the light in all this darkness. Diego's family is acting as an advocate for his needs as he cannot think straight right now and is confused as to what his next step needs to be. Diego is still remembering the night of the fire and cannot comprehend how he is where he is today.

Rapid, on-ground transport of emergency personnel, equipment and supplies into crisis situations while simultaneously rescuing victims in rugged, inaccessible terrain presents significant and dangerous challenges for Search and Rescue and Emergency Response organizations.


USADAR Corporation of Nevada has designed, developed, built, tested and proven a specialized Tactical Ultra Light – Vehicle (TUL-V) that delivers critical transportation capabilities to first-responders serving victims of hurricanes, floods, firestorms, earthquakes, back country injury and other emergencies in remote, extremely difficult to reach locations. This emergency vehicle has been developed in response to an overwhelming need for a reliable, versatile and rugged vehicle that can access the hardest-to-reach places and bring help to those in need.


The TUL-V Model 4 leverages our previous model designs into a fast, modular, multi-purpose platform utilizing innovative off-road technologies that allow it to rapidly access areas unlike any other four wheel vehicle. The Model 4 can go through 42 inches of water, on or off road...

...while carrying up to 12 people and/or a combination of easily interchangeable medical suite, rescue/breaching, fuel/water, fire suppression, cargo or other (PODS) modules...

...and drones for additional search capability.


And now, with exclusive licensing to advanced electric motor technology we are embarking on a hybrid version of the Model 4, allowing the vehicle a range of 800 miles using unique batteries that do not burn up like the toxic, polluting, lithium ion ones.

We are asking for your help to bring the Model 4 and Model 4 Hybrid life-saving vehicles to market.

This funding phase will allow us to continue basic operations, make necessary refinements to Model 4 and to continue to move the Model 4 Hybrid design and testing forward. Our initial goal is to have Model 4 available for deployment in Q4 2018.

We hope you will help support this humanitarian effort.

Mere minutes after getting the evacuation order, the sky became filled with so much smoke that it appeared to be nighttime even though it was just after 8:30am, and then with little warning the Church next to Mel's house began to burn, and so with the very few possessions that they'd had time to grab Mel got her Mom, sister and two fur babies loaded into her car and all thankfully made it out of Paradise safely.   




The next day her cousin was able to get back into Paradise and confirmed that Mel's home (along with her Aunt's home and virtually the entire town of Paradise) had burned down to the ground - and that absolutely nothing was salvageable.  

       

As stated above, Mel and her family barely had time to grab much of anything before fleeing for their lives.  Mel is the primary breadwinner for her family - caring for her disabled sister full-time while also making sure that their Mother's needs are met.   While she owned the Mobile Home that was lost, she did not own the land on which it sat, and so there will be very little insurance monies available to her family.  Since they have literally lost their entire lives there is a lot that will have to be replaced.  

If you can afford to give anything, please consider helping Mel and her family rebuild their lives.  At the moment they have been moving around from house to house staying with friends and family, and while they are safe, the one thing that everyone going through this horrible tragedy is craving is stability.  So if you are able, please join me in helping Mel and her family find that stability so that they can begin to put their lives back together again one piece at a time.  If you are unable to give, please consider sharing this campaign with others so that it reaches a wider audience.  






**Note - I was not sure how much to start the Goal for, and so I decided to go with what I have been told is a typical deductible for insurance claims in situations like this.  Mel and her family are not expecting anything, and so they will be grateful for anything they receive.  Thank you for taking the time to read this!",2360,10000,31,32,247,"PARADISE, CA"," November 15, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34543856_1542274957521205_r.jpeg,32,247,31,0.9934,2598,10000,0.23600000000000002,0,0,"['transport', 'geological phenomenon', 'track', 'disaster', 'tree', 'vehicle', 'pollution']"

These fires destroy many homes, cost millions in damage and even lifes have been lost. Yet humans are the main reason these fires occur. Many people dont realize that wild life can also be the same or even worse in damages.  My goal is to start new growth of life of trees where trees are needed the most. For example, where there is fire damage, floods deforestation communities and parks. Just one tree can have great impact on the environment and benefit all sorts of life. These trees will either be planted from seed or transplant from pots. These trees may include, drought resistant, water resistant, fire resistant, fast growers and most importantly native trees. Lots of research has to be done in wind patterns, annually rainfall, utilities, tree species, ect. I already plant trees on my free time. In the near future I will like to expand my interest this planet with more trees.  Is this is something you are interested in feel free to message me or would like to join. Let make earth a better place for our kids.  Its an all year work but im willing to do this for all of us. 

Fun Facts:
Trees lower air temperature by evaporating water in their leaves.

Trees improve water quality by slowing and filtering rain water, and protecting aquifers and watersheds.

The different parts of a tree grow at different times throughout the year. Typically, most of the foliage growth happens in the spring, followed by trunk growth in the summer and root growth in the fall and winter.",0,3000,0,,,"LOS ANGELES, CA"," December 14, 2017",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/26231256_15133060420_r.jpg,0,0,0,0.9884,1585,3000,0.0,0,0,"['finger', 'hand', 'plant', 'arm', 'tree', 'grass', 'girl', 'grass family', 'neck']"

                        Ann & Greg’s Bear Fire Recovery",https://www.gofundme.com/Help-Ann-and-Greg,Ann & Greg’s Bear Fire Recovery,"We need help to recover from the Bear Fire.  Our two yurt “skins” (the roofs and walls) as well as one of our 5,000 water gallon tanks need to be replaced.  

We were one of only a few landowners who were significantly affected by the Bear Fire in Boulder Creek California.  The wildfire started October 16, 2017 10:30 pm and wasn’t fully contained until October 27th.  California Department of Forestry and our all-volunteer Boulder Creek Fire Department went out of their way to save our yurts, but there was still significant damage to the yurts themselves.  The 30ft. yurt damage is obvious, but we discovered that our 24ft. yurt also sustained damage due to the fierce heat of the fire.  It may have been a slow-moving fire, but the heat was incredibly intense due to the dense underbrush of the forest.

Our Story
When it became clear that the fire was extremely close to us, Greg had me evacuate immediately.  At approximately 1:30am I, along with Jack the cat, left the property and spent all day waiting to hear news from Greg.  Greg, in his youth, fought wildfires near Shasta, so he had a good understanding of what to expect and when to give up the good fight.  He spent the day hosing down the two yurts and dousing embers that preceded the fire.  We didn’t think the fire would affect us, however the wind shifted and it started to head towards our property.  At dusk, Greg knew he had to leave since the fire was headed straight for our yurts – while water and boride had been dropped in the path of the oncoming fire, that activity is always halted at night.  

I spent a rough day wondering how Greg was – our phone reception on the property was spotty, but he checked in sporadically.  All day I heard from friends and family wondering if we were affected by the fire.  At first, I heard the fire was headed in a different direction, so that’s what I (prematurely) texted out to all concerned.  Greg and I finally met up at our friend Randy’s place at 7pm Tuesday night.

Wednesday was a hard day to get through - we got conflicting texts from neighbors – reports of the fire passing us by then reports that our property was burned came in from well-meaning neighbors.  A text sent at 11:15am: “I just talked to big Mike (who volunteers for the Boulder Creek Fire Department).  He said at 9pm last night your place was still ok but that the fire was creeping down from the ridge toward yours and my place – he said point blank “the fire’s probably a lot closer to your house than you think”.”  A text sent at 7:09 pm: “I saw Josh (a neighbor). He said he saw them with hoses at your place but that they weren’t able to save it this afternoon about 4.”

Right before Greg left, he went up to the upper 5,000 gallon water tank (one of two we had) and found that the heat was so fierce right above it that it singed one side of his facial hair!  He knew then it was time to evacuate.  At some point after he left, the tank exploded and approximately 2,000 gallons of water headed in the direction of our two yurts.  While it was a bummer that the tank went, we believe it helped our cause immeasurably.

Thursday, October 19th, Greg was able to get to our property and see for himself – there were 3 fire trucks up at the yurts and many firemen and firewomen were working to save our place.  Needless to say he fell to his knees overwhelmed with gratitude.  The news video attached tells the story much better than I can.  We are so indebted to them – they worked so hard and were clearly very determined and dedicated.  Larry Wooldridge and his crew from La Grande Oregon headed up the effort.  Continued firefighting was conducted by the Boulder Creek Fire Department who came out for several days after the fire passed through to locate and douse hot spots.

Nothing inside the yurt burned – the teak table inherited from my parents has a few burn marks, but that’s the extent of the burn damage.  The 30ft yurt wall and roof melted in one area, as you can see in the picture.  You can see from another picture that we have tarped the area where the wall and roof melted – we check it often to make sure no water is getting in.  We initially thought the 24ft. yurt escaped any damage, but Greg has discovered that the wall and roof sustained heat damage.  We are still assessing and dealing with the smoke damage.  The 30ft. yurt, which is our living space, still has a noticeable smoke smell.  We have been going to the property most weekend days and some week days to pack up belongings and to clean what we can, but the smoke residue makes the yurt unlivable.  We are hoping an air unit will remove the smell, while we remove the objects that are contributing to it.  

Our friends the Barton’s have opened up their home to us.  Bebe and Dave are truly generous people – they have been so kind and loving during this very trying and emotional time.  Greg and I do not easily ask for help, but we have been taken in and are still staying with them as we work to get our place livable.  We cannot thank them enough for the open-ended invitation to live in their home.

As a side note, our cat has been happily living in my Subaru Forester.  Who knew he was a car cat?  He’s doing remarkably well for a 12-year-old cat that is used to roaming our property at will. He travels with me much of the time and has full reign of the car, but it’s true that he prefers the passenger seat with the seat warmer on “high”!  And of course we spoil him – he’s been one of the few bright spots in this otherwise upsetting experience.

Our Financial Needs
Here are our needs:
1) 5,000 gallon tank (delivered)      $3,600                                
2) 24ft. yurt roof and wall (with insulation)  $9,000
3) 30ft. yurt roof and wall (with insulation)   $12,000
4) Cistern for 24ft. yurt                          $   420

 Due to winter rains, we will not be able to replace the walls and roofs of both yurts until springtime.  The cistern is a new addition for us, not a replacement as the other items are.  We determined that we need to gather more water for just such emergencies as we just went through.

Sharing and/or Donating
We are hopeful that you will consider a donation to help us replace what was lost to the fire as well as better prepare in the event of another wildfire.  Your support will be so very much appreciated.

  She has lost everything in the fire that consumed her home in the girl's dorm in Ojai CA.

  Thankfully, she did get out with her pets and her car and is now in interim housing. But her apartment was leveled. Jen only had a few pieces of clothing - two days worth when they loaded the bus and left campus in minutes.  Her bedroom, kitchen, and living room furniture, tv&stereo equipment, lots of cd & dvds (~400), a family cedar chest, and clothing had all made it from OH & PA to CA are gone.

    She had no apartment/renters insurance,
    as it is not available in a National Forest, 
    which is where OVS is located.  Jen has lost
    of all of her belongings to this fire.

  I am Terry, her brother. in Ohio.  I have to say thanks to our cousin Gabe who thought of the idea of raising  contributions to help offset these losses, and to Kristin who gave us ideas of different sites to consider for this fundraising. Thanks also to Chanin & Ron.

 This is / was Jenny's apartment shown by the La Times after the fire destroyed a portion of her school in Ojai, CA:  http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-southern-california-wildfires-live-the-fire-damaged-ojai-valley-school-s-1512597990-htmlstory.html         This is the Ojai Valley School - Upper Campus, in Ojai, CA.  I had been out there a couple years ago (along with our mom - Nonie Weiss), and all I can recognize is the water pipe on the left side, heading upstairs to where her apartment had been behind the fireplace in the dorm's common room.  We had been texting, and there was concern that the fire, which was 5 miles away, might make it towards the school and they may have to evacuate sometime, maybe overnight.    (Jen's pic: Thomas Fire, 5 miles from campus)

   In the next 18 minutes she was told to clear the girls from the dorm and head out as the fire had closed to less than 2 miles.   The upper campus was evacuated, and she only had time to text me she had the dogs. I thought she was on a bus with the kids.  Later, I learned she was able to get her car out as well, as were the other residents of the upper campus.
 
  In hurricanes, windows get blown out and doors come off their hinges.  This is also what happened to Jenny's concrete apartment in a fire that moved through at 110mph:

  The school is also in need of help. Two buildings, a large bank of solar panel/arrays, and infrastructure have been lost to this still ongoing fire.  OVS plans to be open for class in January of 2018.  

  Contribute now, so that she may be ready to return to teaching in January, 2018.   Please help us support her as she recovers from the loss of her home.

Hello, my name is Marilu of K&M Mini Pot Belly Pig Rescue and we are currently trying to raise funds to help this beautiful girl, who fell victim to the Northern California wildfire. 
The pig community and network we work closely with received an email asking if we could help find a temporary home for this sweet girl who’d been saved from the Mendocino fires... we were aware she had a broken leg and knew little else about her initially. Of course what we did know is we had to step up immediately and take her in. The following day, after the emergency veterinarians and surgeon were able to asses the damage done to her leg, they determined she’d need to have surgery in order to ensure she’d heal properly and wouldn’t lose her leg. Dr. Bachman would like to do the surgery this weekend as we you don’t have time to spare in situations like this. However, we need $1000 to make this happen! Of course there will be after care and recovery costs involved of unknown amounts at this time as well. 

This poor girl has survived and lost so much already - will you PLEASE help us ensure her future and donate ANY amount to help us reach our goal?!

A couple weeks ago both Northern and Southern California were ravaged by wildfires. The Campfire in Northern California destroyed an entire town, and the Thousand Oaks fire managed to spread all the way to Malibu also causing many families to flee the area with little to no warning. 

Many many many homes and businesses were completely destroyed, and first responder and firefighters are still looking for survivors. Thousands of people fled from the wall of flames, and many had no choice but their pets behind, or couldn’t get home in time to rescue their furry family members. Wildlife has also been seen trying to flee the area that soon became surrounded by the wall of flames that was destroying everything.

Hi, my name is Yegor Nadvornyy and I'm setting up this campaign to raise any funds possible to help firefighters and victims of the deadliest and the most distractive wildfire California ever had. 

I want to use the social media power for good by inviting businesses and individuals to donate.

We invite other businesses to donate a giveaway as an incentive for your donations. 

To kick it off, my own business, brainrichkids.com, will donate one play gym of your choice to a randomly selected person who donates at least $5 to this campaign. 


We will be directing collected funds towards the places and people that need it the most, starting with the LAFD Foundation @LAFDFoundation so they could continue fighting the fire. 

You can also donate directly if you'd like by visiting  www.supportLAFD.org. Any help is definitely appreciated by them. 

When donating, you can also let us know if you know of an organization that we are not aware of and you think needs an attention. 

I will personally make sure to update you on the additional participating businesses we bring in and organizations we chose to direct funds to. 

If you are a business owner, we invite you to join the cause as well but we ask not to use it for your advertising purposes. 

As a business owner, it is my duty and a privilege to be able to help people in need. 

We will also donate all the profits we generate for the next 3 weeks to the victims of this catastrophe. 

We encourage you to donate, spread the word and invite others to participate. Any help counts.",213,10000,6,5,3,"BELLEVUE, WA"," November 11, 2018",,5,3,6,-0.778,2837,10000,0.0213,0,0,

I am absolutely overwhelmed and heart broken to see the devastating damage created by the California Camp Fire. It has dislocated many families including my friends and colleagues, leaving a haunting memory in their mind. I am in pain thinking about little children and their parents who have been displaced and might not have family to support them. I wish I could help them all. It will take many months till the impact of this devastating fire is erased from everyone's memory.

If you are feeling overwhelmed and helpless then please join me as a team member and help me raise $5000 that I can donate to North Valley Community Foundation - Campfire Relief Fund  raised for women and children. 

Please note NVCF will designate 1% of all fire relief donations to help cover the cost of administration and management of the fund. I ensure every single cent raised (aside from GoFundMe fees) will be spent helping the victims of the Camp Fire recover from this tragedy.

Our new California Wildfire Grant Fund has been established specifically to help those who are living with Parkinson's and who have been affected by the California wildfires. 

Parkinson’s Disease sufferers – particularly the elderly – face exceptional expenses, even at the best of times. They may need special equipment such as hospital beds to aid with getting up and out; with Parkinson’s they are often up 6 or more times a night to visit the bathroom. They may need a walk-in shower (tubs are often too hard to navigate), they may need railing in the house (without railing they tend to fall down more often), and they should ideally have a place to stay with no steps.

With the prospect of extended displacement as a result of the California wildfires, many will need added support to make their temporary accommodations meet their needs, be it for a few weeks or many, many months.

Our longer view with this Fund is to help those living with Parkinson's rebuild following the wildfires.

Please give generously to help those with Parkinson’s who are in need at this time.

We have allocated $10,000 from our own fundraising throughout the year, but the needs are substantial and we're hoping to at least double the size of the Fund. Applications to gain access to funds are currently being accepted.

Abby and her parents have lived year-round at a camp in California since the day she was born, where her father runs the camp’s maintenance.  The family managed to narrowly escape their home before the entire camp burned down in the recent wildfires.  Abby has been a valued volunteer at the camp for many years.  “This past summer Abby worked for our horse program and was an amazing asset to have.  She has been a wonderful part of our camp family,” said the camp’s Director.
 
Abby and her parents were lucky to be taken in by another family, where the three live in cramped quarters in the family’s guest room.  Despite this huge disruption in her family’s life, Abby continues to attend high school.  Abby needs a computer, printer, calculator and other items to continue to succeed as she pursues her education.  Abby’s parents currently do not have the financial resources to provide their daughter with many of the items needed to complete school assignments and to go about her life as a high school student.  They are most appreciative of any help they can receive.

Once Abby’s needs are met, one2one USA and HBO will disburse remaining donations to other victims of the California fire or to another one2one USA – HBO program.  The deadline to donate to this campaign is December 23rd, 2018.",1800,10000,14,14,5,"NEW YORK, NY"," November 30, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34983790_1543601785361331_r.jpeg,14,5,14,0.9854,1945,10000,0.18,0,0,"['text', 'font', 'product', 'product', 'line', 'area', 'brand', 'organization']"

                        Rebuild The House of Two Spirits",https://www.gofundme.com/rebuild-the-house-of-two-spirits,Rebuild The House of Two Spirits,"Imagine this - you wake up up one day and your home and business have been decimated by fire and you're not insured.  

This is a reality for Pamela Robins. 

The author of Mediating with Animals and owner of the House of Two Spirits, sadly lost her home and beloved tipi during the recent wildfires in California.  


This Go Fund Me campaign is dedicated to a unique human who has helped many people heal.  

You may have heard of this little piece of paradise in the Agoura Hills from a friend or on Instagram.  For those of you lucky enough to visit the Tipi, I'll guarantee that you'll have left Pamela's home feeling much better than you did when you arrived.  It was truly special and we have Pamela to thank for creating it.


A series of major life events led to the creation of this tipi. Starting with the death of her mother, a bout with cancer, paralyzed vocal chords and the loss of her marital home - they all combined to create a space in Pamela's life for the tipi to rise. 

It was her fearless creativity that enabled her to single-handedly create the Tipi in God's own country, guided by divine grace, surrounded by mountains and stewarded by the animals.  It was nature's stage - noble birds would guard the poles and the coyotes would sing at the end of a sound healing workshop, as if on cue.  Pamela recalled that at her last retreat the coyotes didn't sing.  ""I wanted so much for everyone to hear them, so I closed my eyes and asked for my friends the coyotes to sing for my guests.""  Of course they blessed Pamela with a brilliant encore - such is her gift and connection with the animal world, as well as the sacred space that she created. 


Pamela's open-hearted willingness to welcome people to her back yard to host healing experiences in nature is unique in this day and age.  But she is unique - and her generosity of spirit knows no bounds.  Even in her darkest hour when she had learned that everything was gone (except her car, her cats and her instruments), she demonstrated an unswerving grace under pressure. 



When I suggested that we start a Go Fund Me page for Pamela she, true to form, replied ""No, no - so many more people need help I can't possibly ask!"" When I pointed out to her that most people didn't open their door to strangers every week for healing ceremonies she gracefully (and grudgingly) acquiesced.   She is learning to accept help - so let's give her some!! 

Pamela has lost her home, all her possessions and business so she needs us to STAND UP AND BE HER TIPI POLES.  If you're half as willing as Pamela to help humanity, then this Go Fund Me will be a huge success. 


So, whilst she is recovering from this traumatic ordeal and working out where to boldly go next, she needs assistance and she's not very good at asking for help, so we're doing it on her behalf.  Having lost all her possessions in the fire that engulfed her home she needs clothing and a safe place to accommodate her cats as they are traumatized from constant moving.  I should add, most importantly that Pamela, her two cats and beloved horse Tuxedo are all safe.  

The funds will be used for:

Clothing and personal resources
A safe place for her cats 
A temporary base for Pamela 
A deposit for a new space for a healing centre (she has already identified a piece of property)
The purchase of new tipis and infrastructure for a healing centre

The Group raising the money on behalf of Pamela are her colleagues and dear friends.  

The House of Two Spirits will continue because Pamela will continue.  She has identified a new piece of land that is suitable for a healing space, so supporting her will help Pamela, her work (and tipi) rise from the ashes.   


Gifting today is a gift to humanity, so sacrifice your daily Starbucks to help this beautiful human rebuild her life and community.

After the fires have destroyed so many homes, the community needs a healing space more than ever.  This campaign will help Pamela and her team create a new space in a new location and build a beautiful healing retreat for us all to enjoy for many years.  

Let's all rise together as a pole to Pamela's Tipi until she can rebuild a new one. 

With all our love,

The House of Two Spirits Team

I’m Jack McNassar’s sister. I have created this account to help his family recover from the devastating California wildfire. Funds will be used to purchase necessities, cover living expenses, find a new home and help to purchase another vehicle (they drove out with one). Donations will be deposited directly to their bank account.

On Thursday, November 8th 2018 the lives of Jack, Melissa and Mary McNassar were changed forever. In the early morning hours they were alerted to a wildfire in the area (Paradise, California) and were told to evacuate immediately. Without hesitation, Jack and Melissa worked to quickly load emergency supplies into their car while keeping Mary calm and helping to alert neighbors. This was a rapidly moving fire (now know as Camp Fire) burning 8 football fields per minute. The most devastating wildfire in California history.  

Jack, Melissa and Mary endured 6 long hours of terrifying chaos driving through flames, ashes and fear to safety. The evacuation route was clogged and they at times feared certain death. It was their love for sweet Mary that gave Jack and Melissa the courage to endure and presence to stay calm. 

Essentially, they left their home with a few supplies and the clothes on their backs. The town of Paradise, California and surrounding areas lies in ashes. The family is safe, but has a long hard road ahead. All they have worked for, all the treasured belongings gathered over a life time, the comforts of home are gone. 

I am asking for help for them to lift the financial burden during this extremely difficult time. Jack is a War veteran, having served two tours in the Middle East as a combat medic. He’s a strong and courageous  man,  but also has the biggest heart of anyone I know. He has laid his life down for others without a second thought, he’d give you his last dollar, the shirt off his back. Now it’s time for us to give back to him, to ease the burdens of his heart. Melissa is a loving mother, one who longs to protect her beautiful daughter. Let’s help her do that. Mary, sweet beautiful Mary, is but a three year old child who has been through a horrible tragedy no one should ever endure. Help me provide her with necessities and comforts.

Governor Jerry Brown has declared the fires a major disaster, and is requesting federal emergency funds to aid families and communities affected by the fires.

The fire has claimed the lives of 40 individuals and more than 200 people are missing. It has also burned more than 6,700 homes and businesses in Paradise and its surrounding areas. The fire is now tied for the deadliest on record in California state history.

At the same time, the Woolsey and Hill fires are raging on in Southern California. The Woolsey Fire claimed the lives of people in Malibu and surrounding communities. The fires have damaged hundreds of homes and beachside residents.

Congress, despite the $81 billion disaster aid package, has fallen short of fully funding the rebuilding of California resulting in a multimillion dollar job left for the community to subsidize.  The near 100,000 who fortunately escaped the grips of the flames and fumes, are now left homeless, seeking help from organizations such as the American Red Cross, which provides shelter and supplies for those in need of help. Housing has become scarce and many now live in houses known previously as undesirable.

 The Californian Fire scorched 281,000 acres of land, setting the record for largest wildfire in California history beginning it’s devastation on December 4, 2017 with its size quickly multiplying. With no known cause, the inferno blazed on for a month and a half before wildfire “Thomas” was contained at the cost of 1 firefighter and 47 civilian lives on January 12, 2018. The fire destroyed over 1,000 buildings including 751 homes leaving entire families without shelter desperately requiring aid. 

 The rising of the fire has encouraged countless communities to come together. Many organizations such as the American Red Cross are taking donations in order to support those left in shambles. They also have set up many shelters for those who are now homeless due to wildfires. Meeting the fundraiser's objective will help relieve the pressure of financial stress put on families everywhere and further aid these organizations with the means to purchase resources to rebuild the state.

The death toll from the California wildfires has climbed to 50.  I work closely with medical facilities in many specialties. A specific facility in California has been victim of these wildfires, losing four of their locations. This facility is a residential addiction rehab center.  

Those struggling with addiction are suffering in the inside on so many levels. Self worth, adequacy, loyalty, trust, commitment, fear of failure. My heart really aches for this facility and their residents. Here people are trying to get better and this probably feels like the world is against them. 

I am taking it in my own hands to raise money for this recovery center so they can get back on their feet and continue to do good work. Having multiple locations is so important in addiction rehabilitation. The more open beds the more people they can help. Hopefully this story touches you like it touched me.

Their little life was perfect with each other.

November 8th the largest and deadliest wildfire in California history started around 6:20 AM in the Camp Creek area of Concow, Ca (15  miles east of Paradise). The fire was started because of downed power lines  arcing.  Poor Forest management, a high winds,  extreme fire danger, and PG&E choosing not to initiate preventative power outages all contributed to the ignition and severity of the fire. 
 
November 8th started like any other day. Lucretia and Jazzy woke up (6:30 AM) to get ready for the day. Jazzy made her morning call to her mom. Jazzy was excited about being able to walk from school to the park for the first time. This is the first they would heard about the fire in Concow. It was far away nothing to be worried about. Lucretia and Jazzy finished getting ready and ate breakfast together. As Lucretia was pulling her car out of the garage (7 AM)  she remembers looking up at the dark ominous sky and thinking "" so glad that I am not in Oklahoma anymore or I would be running to the cellar"".  

The drive to school was as normal as could be until they arrived to school. Instead of the normal good morning greetings at the drop off line they were told no school today due to the fire in Concow.  Once they arrived home  (7:30 AM) they turned on the news. No evacuation orders in town. Within minutes Jazzy's mom calls and tells them to pack a few things just in case. They continue to watch the news for any updates. Besides the really dark ""clouds"" nothing seems wrong. By 8 AM Jazzy's mom calls very alarmed tells them its time to go. ""Grab your  stuff and head to the Chico stake center"", she told them. News  was still reporting nothing for the town of Paradise other than a small brush fire 20-30 acres in the Camp Creek area. Lucretia retrieves 1 of 4 large family journals on the first trip to the car. When she stepped outside it looked like it was midnight. The sun was barely visible through the clouds and smoke, and it looked very red. Ash was lightly sprinkling out of the sky.

Their once quiet street had become busy. The neighbor next door was throwing things in her car. The other neighbor came flying down the road and skidded into her lawn yelling we have to get out now. Lucretia quickly went inside to retrieve another journal. When she stepped outside the second time the ash  was falling heavily along with debris. The neighbor who was packing her car the first trip in screaming that her car will not start. Neighbors started helping each other load kids into cars and jump start the car with a dead battery. Suddenly explosions shook the ground beneath their feet. The tanks at the nearby gas station had just blown up. 

Lucretia realized that there was no time. She hustled Jazzy and Gracie dog into the car and asked her neighbor to please drive them out.  During the drive out of town, people were crying and frantically trying to get to safety.  The roads were bumper to bumper but moving at a turtle pace. People were running down  Skyway (the road to Chico) with kids in their arms, a mother was running with her kids packed into a stroller and a baby strapped to her chest, people were riding on trucks and in boats in tow.  The once 15 minute drive to Chico took hours. They were among the lucky ones that made it safely to Chico.  

On November 10th, Lucretia Barton's 91st birthday, she received the devastating news that she  had lost her home of 50+ years were she raised her children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. She also lost her rental, which was her main source of income, her garage, and so much more. The once beautiful Paradise had turned into a fiery hell. The town was burnt out and very little survived. Hundreds are still missing and so many lives were lost. The devastation was profound.

 Starting over is not easy specially at 91 years old. They only escaped with 2 family journals and the clothes on their backs. For the first time in her 91 years she was homeless.

Jose Uriarte's taco and burrito shop, Gordo Burrito in Chico, CA, is just outside the wildfire's range.  Every day, Jose, who immigrated from Guamuchil, Sinaloa, gives free food to the firefighters, EMTs, police and social workers working tirelessly to serve their fire-ravaged community.


 Sunday, he closed up the storefront, gathered up a crew, and drove his taco truck out to the Elk's Lodge wildfire evacuation camp.  The scene that greeted him was apocalyptic.

In a phone interview, Jose could not find words to describe the scope of the devastation.  ""It's so...big,"" he said, before going on to describe how the dense smoke blocked out the sun and made everything ""cold and surreal.""

When he arrived at the Elk's Lodge refuge, Jose was met by hundreds of shell-shocked evacuees, families who had lost everything: their homes, jobs, all their possessions.
 
So he got to work, giving out tacos, burritos, and tamales to over 300 people. Latinlive learned about the story of Jose Uriarte and decided to help him out by creating the GOFUNDME page for him.

The student's mother and younger sister escaped the burning town of Paradise, CA with nothing more than the clothes on their backs and minutes to spare. The family's home and belongings have been completely lost to the monstrous blaze. An undoubtedly difficult road lies ahead for the small family. Your support is greatly needed!

Arianna Sells is currently in her second year of attendance at the prestigious University of California, Santa Barbara where she is working to complete her Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy of Ethics and Public Policy. Sells is an active member of the UCSB Letters and Sciences Honors Program currently holding an impressive 3.76 cumulative GPA. She made Dean's Honors twice during her first year and is on track to do so again for the fall 2018 quarter. Sells currently serves on the Executive Board of UCSB's Residential Housing Association's Hall Council and is employed as a CalFresh Advocate and Food Security Peer to help eradicate food insecurity on campus. Sells is a first generation college student with aspirations to attend a top tier law school such as Harvard University or Columbia University upon graduation from UCSB in 2021.

Sells has participated in many programs dedicated to serving her now devastated community of Butte County. In 2014 and 2016, she served as Head Writer for the annual Mock Trial Script Writing Project in cooperation with the Butte County Superior Court's Civic Learning Partnership. The project educated local elementary students about the inner workings of the American justice system at both federal and state levels. During 2017 and 2018, Sells worked with the Butte County Office of Education to implement new student programs focused on bringing educational opportunities to underserved youth populations. Sells was a key member in the creation of Butte County's first ever competitive high school fishing league and Northern California's first ever competitive esports league for high school students. Visit the leagues' sites here: Butte County High School Anglers & Northern California Esports League. 

Having held continuous employment since the age of fourteen, Arianna Sells has largely been able to fund her own education at UCSB. Due to the massive destruction of the Camp Fire however, the second year honors student will need to assist her family financially in the months to come. Tragedies of this magnitude have the ability to derail the dreams and ambitions of many bright and promising students. We are asking you to help support this young individual as she continues her educational pursuits in the face of total loss. 

Please refer to the graphics below for a detailed description of how funds raised from this campaign will be dispersed.

I am writing to seek assistance for my my family members who live in Redding, California.   My daughter Aisha, son Devante, and 3 grandchildren fled their home in Redding, California yesterday due to a massive mandatory evacuation of residents, resulting from the massive wild fire (being called a tornado fire) that has consumed 45,000 acres over the past couple of days and has now invaded the city of Redding, CA. At this point the fire is only 3% contained. There was very little notice for her to gather more than a few things, her kids, and all their pets to flee from the town.  She took 2 homeless youths, aged 17 and 21 with her, as well as 2 people from her church and headed out of the area to a camp ground about an hour and a half away. She only had enough money for gas to get away and to feed everyone last night. Her car was covered in ash and the air conditioning stopped working It is currently between 100 and 114 degrees and is expected to remain in triple digits for the coming week. The area where they are now staying is in a mountainous region and the temperatures dip down at night.  
They are in dire need of immediate help!  They have an immediate need for money to buy tents, sleeping bags pillows, blankets, food, personal care items, camp fees for lodging, gas, the everyday living expenses and necessities for 9 people and 4 pets, as well as a repair for the air conditioning on the car. 
Anything that you can do to help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you and God bless you!

The devastation is staggering. I am a owner-operator truck driver who owns my own tractors and trailers. During my visit to California since the fires, I have met so many folks who have barely escaped with their lives. 

Most people had to flee with just the clothes on their backs. Many of them setting up camp in parking lots in tents and makeshift campers. The State of California from what I hear is doing little to help these fire victims. 

While no charity could ever make everyone whole again, while these folks fight with insurance companies to pay their claims, they have very real, immediate needs that must be addressed, and too often relying on government and insurance to respond faster, only results in disappointment and frustration, yielding no results.

In my capacity, I will be donating my time and use my equipment to fill my trailer with basic needs items: Blankets, water, food, clothes, tents, first-aid, toiletries, etc., maybe even some toys for children who are devastated this holiday season. I will fill it as many times as I can, reaching out to the many companies I have come to know in my travels to purchase these items and deliver them directly.

There are many campaigns out there, and they all are geared to helping one particular family, which is great, but I am hoping to make a much broader, immediate impact for as many as I can.

Many have reached out to our organization asking us how we plan to “retaliate” for the vandalization of our beloved Bruin Bear at the heart of UCLA’s campus. We have thought long and hard over the past 24 hours as to how True Bruins would respond to something like this.

We’ve decided in True Bruin spirit that we would like to take this opportunity to make a difference. Last time the Bruin Bear was defaced it cost the University nearly $20,000 to erase the vandalism . We thank UCLA and those who helped pay for and have been working tirelessly fix the damages to the bear. We’d like to match the estimated repair costs to donate to victims of the recent wildfires that have devastated our state. We are asking YOU, whether you are a UCLA student, alumni, faculty, or anyone from around the world, to help US truly make a difference by donating to support those who have been devastated by the recent fires. Every dollar raised from this campaign will go to the Red Cross’ California Wildfire Recovery Fund. We thank you for helping us “retaliate” with kindness!

 Covering almost 30 square miles in mud, debris and desctruction the only corridor from the south, where many of the staff have residence, the staff have now become isolated from the Zoo. Cal Trans authorities have reported that the 101 will be closed indefinately.  

The staff at the Santa Barbara Zoo are having to choose to drive an extra 4 to 5 hour drive (preivously 1 hour with traffic), or purchase tickets for Amtrak or a boat ride out of their own pocket. Many of these dedicated staff members already had evcauate due to the Thomas Fire and have lost income due to the fire. Now staff have the extra burden to pay an exorbant amount of money to get to work.

We are asking for funds to help reminburse staff for train, boat and gas money to get to work. A one way Amtrack ticket is $15 - $25 each way, tickets on the converted whale watching boats, now serving as a ferry are $32 each direction.

Thankfully no staff were directly impacted by the mudslide, but some have had to evacuate and have been ""camping out"" at the Zoo and are doing well.

As many of you know, my beautiful home of California is in a state of emergency. We are experiencing the worst wildfire in history and the effects are devastating to say the least. Hundreds of thousands of acres (filled with homes, families, animals, memories, agriculture, and businesses) are being decimated as I write this. Hundreds of communities have been displaced and the death toll is only increasing. I am asking for your help during this time of need. 

Let’s band together and do our part to aid as many people/animals possible that have been affected.  

Firefighters, medical professionals, and volunteers need our help. These brave individuals are working around the clock (some longer than 24-hour shifts) in attempt to save people, land, and animals from the blazes. 

I have created this Go-Fund-Me to collect donations from my friends and family. 100% of proceeds will go to directly aid the people and animals affected by the California wildfire. 

I have selected two charities to donate too:
1. California Fire Foundation
2. VCA (to help the animals)

Go-Fund me does not do split donations, so this page is dedicated to VCA Charities. Please read the descriptions below and select the one that you would like to contribute to!

For this charity, my goal is $1,250 USD, and my generous employer will match all donations! That said, the hope is to donate $2,500 in total to VCA Charities. We will be setting the same goal for The California Fire Foundation. This means $5,000 in total to support those affected!

The money donated to VCA will go to aiding the animals affected by the fired. They have been giving first aid to animals that have been burned or otherwise affected by the fires, and providing pet food and other supplies. The number of animals under their care has risen significantly since the wildfires starting. 

The California Fire Foundation provides support for firefighters and the families of those who have died while at work. This money will help us commemorate fallen heroes, offer scholarships to children of fallen firefighters, and provide aid to victims of fire or other natural disaster, ensuring that firefighters and their loved ones are forever cared for, as well as those they shelter from disaster.

If you want to donate to help the animals affected (VCA Charities), you are on the right page.

Every penny counts. Please help me in giving back in any way possible. No amount is too small. 

PS- Please share this link. The more people that are aware, the more of an impact we can make.

 On December 4th, 2017, with 15 minutes to evacuate, they lost their home and everything in it, to Southern California's largest wildfire in history - the Thomas Fire.  With winds up to 70 mph, this fierce fire consumed over 1000 homes and structures within just a few days.  It was a shocking event that stunned the community.  Having just lost all of their possessions and their home, this tragic event left Sierra and Canyon, brother and sister duo, sad but also curious and inspired, so they set out to make a motivational documentary about those devastated and deeply affected by the fire to document people moving from fire victim to VICTORY and tragedy to triumph in a short amount of time. 

 With an experienced videographer and editing team (some paid and some trade) to help create this fresh account, they need help in funding this documentary. With mentorship by Humanitarian Photojournalist, Jacob Foko and Blue World Media Network, they are moving forward fast, with this creation.  In addition to production costs, they will be raising money to help pay for marketing, transportation, accommodations and other needs accrued while submitting to and attending film festivals around the world!

 Your support will ensure that Sierra and Canyon can complete this documentary, including but not limited to; Music Composition, Color Grading, ADR, Visual FX and Entries into National and International Short Film Festivals and possibly other online content servers. 

 With the funds raised from your support and with self funding, they aim to create this FRESH documentary with a final product completed by February 28, 2018, to meet entry deadlines into National and International Short Film Festivals.

 Your support will help empower their vision, to INSPIRE and MOTIVATE others around the world and to help people transition through trauma, tragedy and everyday challenges to a place of Triumph and Victory. Your support will allow them to share their work, passion and vision with the world.  All who contribute financially will benefit from helping motivate and inspire others. It's the gift of giving!

A group of wine country area moms who felt this tragedy firsthand reached out to me and told me what the kids in the shelter & temporary homes want and have been asking for most are art supplies to play with.  As an artist based in Silicon Valley, this really resonated with me, so I started this GoFundMe.   

Why Not Just Give Them Food & Supplies?
In a crisis as big as the California wildfires, people’s first response is to send basic supplies, food and water, and that’s essential.   However, in these  dark and traumatic times, we believe food for the soul is also essential.  In fact, put yourself in their shoes for a moment---getting only canned food and bundles of socks may be even more depressing.  Here are a few reasons why I am excited about helping get some beautiful high-quality art supplies and creative kits into the hands of these kids.

1) Healing:  Art is therapeutic, cathartic and rejuvenating for these kids and families.

2) Dreaming again: At a dark time, art can be a spark of light that encourages these kids to dream again if only for a short time.

3) Telling their story:  Art supplies gives these kids a voice.  Young, many now homeless, and some undocumented, all of them are feeling the financial blow of this tragedy.  It’s important that we listen to what they want to tell us.

Where your money will go?
We are sending the funds directly to University Art Center in Redwood City to purchase the art supplies.   University Art is generously doing a matching campaign.   For every dollar you help us raise, they are donating an additional dollar of product.   University Art is also generously helping with logistical support and shipping.

Reward Levels
Thanks to the generosity of BeWell and our other donors  --- For an $80 or higher donation, you will be gifted a Love is Thicker Than Smoke T-Shirt.  (First 50 donors only).

For a $200 or higher donation, you will be gifted a select bottle of Napa or Sonoma.  (First 50 donors only – Bay Area donors only).

And remember – your contribution is being matched by University Art.  

Distrubution - It Takes a Village!
Thanks to BeWell Napa and Nimbus Arts who will be coordinating on the ground and helping distribute to the schools, communities and shelters of greatest need.  Be Well is active in implementing children's wellness programs in the Napa Valley. Nimbus is dedicated to nurturing and fostering creativity and building a sense of community through art.

Additionally, I am forming a team to organize transitional housing on land near Chico, for those residents that cannot move to the selters in other cities, due to family support or jobs they have in Chico.

The funds are not being delivered directly to families. I have been feeding and relocating victims to alternative housing and shelters. This comes in transportation of needed food and travel services from myself and a small group of friends We have been self funded and have exhausted our resources to the time of some $5000 USD We are keeping it going but the money for fuel and trailer rentals are becoming beyond our groups ability to sustain without help from others

Hello friends and family.

The devastation  from the California wildfires is vast.

I am mobilizing and organizing for two primary initiatives.

1)  Thanksgiving food bank distribution 

2)  Housing for those who lost their homes.

I am sponsoring 4 families for the holidays.  Our goal is to House and feed four families during the months of December and January as well as provide basic infrastructure for them to settle their lives and help with insurers.

We are also trafficking and providing basic food and clothing needs for all in need.

When I opened Physics Phor Phun Tutoring   and began tutoring math and science in 2006, my inspiration was a mother's son asking her for help, help which she didn't know how to give. The schools have to send children home to be helped by their parents. The expectation is not just that parents will ensure the homework is done, but that they will help the students figure out how to do it too. Sometimes that works if the parents are educated and have time. Sometimes it doesn’t, especially for the underserved and underrepresented [M. Greenman, A. Duffy, Project accelerate: Bringing AP physics 1 to underserved students, Phys. Teach, 56, 626 (2018); G. White, Sex, gender, and physics, and the introductory physics classroom, Phys. Teach 56, 580 (2018)].

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the foundation of my business. I want to get back to the roots of what I set out to do 12 years ago. My mission is:

 
""to help the underprivileged and underrepresented gain a voice through education and research."" 

 
To that end I am trying to raise money to pay for tutoring scholarships for underserved and underrepresented students: to help the underserved gain access to this useful resource, and encourage more of the underrepresented to become interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

Your donations will go to help a deserving student break through the educational barriers that education is meant to equalize. For $1200, one student can receive tutoring for an entire semester: five scholarships are available, and any amount you donate will be applied to a scholarship. That’s a one-hour appointment every week, plus unlimited mobile help between sessions: everyone gets free access to the website at  www.physicsphorphun.com . Students will qualify based on need and a demonstrated commitment to a program of study. Students will be asked to pay a small hourly fee, which will be used to provide grade incentives. Updates will be provided periodically through the Physics Phor Phun Tutoring Facebook page.

 

So, if you’ve already given to the California wildfires , and a children’s hospital , and your favorite cause, and you’re still looking to give, I hope you will consider a donation to Physics Phor Phun Tutoring’s “Scholarships for STEM Tutoring.” You can find more information about Physics Phor Phun Tutoring on our Facebook page , and on our website  www.physicsphorphun.com .

A mother/son produced documentary about LGBTQ  members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, their families, and the growing rate of suicide among this unique demographic.
What is about to be a breakthrough film told through the lens of an Openly Gay “Mormon” (who recently sang in rehearsal w/The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square while they were on tour in California) with a passion for Suicide Prevention and what the future holds between the LDS/LGBTQ communities. With the love and support of so many celebrity and non-celebrity allies alike, we hope we are closing in on this gap, and to continue educating people globally that being a member of the LGBTQ community is NOT a sin, a mental illness, or a psychological disorder. In fact, if you ask Jake Hanson, he claims his homosexuality has been a blessing to him, his family, and the church.



*THE SUICIDE RATE AMONG LGBTQ LDS Members  IS UNACCEPTABLE!

* I WANT TO SHOW SUPPORT TO MY FELLOW LGBTQ PEERS, WHILE SHOWING MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS THAT ACCEPTANCE AND LOVE IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE- BUT IS REQUIRED BY OUR FAITH.* 

Identifying as LGBTQ is NOT a sickness, an illness, or something that can be reversed. In fact, I BELIEVE IT’S A BLESSING!

If you want a more in-depth vision of my goal then keep reading, HOWEVER,  if you are satisfied with what you have read so far and would like to support this documentary film-  I thank you in advance for your donation and YOU will be credited  in the final cut of #LoveOneAnother (Projected Autumn 2019 Release Date)  See you at the Premiere! ;-)

Our Story:

I was originally inspired last Autumn when I was working as an actor on a very popular Netflix series called 13 Reasons Why, which coincidentally takes place around the aftermath of a teen suicide.  So for my facebook  birthday fundraiser in October I raised around $800  for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), who I plan on working very closely with during the making of #LoveOneAnother, especially after meeting with two of their volunteers (one pictured below) back in Utah this past July. (LoveLoud Fest 2018!)

￼

Addiction. 

Gay. ️‍

Mormon. 

Suicide.
   
This openly gay Mormon will (and has) candidly gone where no documentary has ventured - including the examination of the disturbingly high suicide rates we see by active/or not yet out LGBTQ members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints today. 
With the church membership in the millions, that statistically puts thousands at risk. So where does the suicide prevention come into play? 

If at all? 

And how? 

My goal is to HELP aid in bridging the gap between the LDS and the LGBTQ communities. The suicide rates are rising yearly because so many youth (and adults) do NOT feel safe saying out loud who they really are or how they truly feel. For many this is too much to handle and the outcome is often suicide. My goal is to show that it’s PERFECTLY OK to be gay and LDS- or anywhere on the spectrum that you identify as. 

￼

We are already lining up multiple interviews with families who have lost a loved one so we can show the aftermath of what its like to lose someone who was close to them. 

*Also, on that note- if YOU have a story to share or know someone that we should meet or interview,* PLEASE contact us either on here or directly at our website,  www.loveoneanotherfilm.com 

We are also in the first stages of contacting some key non-profits who specialize on these topics for interviews and clarification of the current statistics and what many of them are doing going forward regarding mental illness, addiction, and suicide. 

I, myself have been in that deep dark place of wanting a way out. I don’t want any of these deaths to have been in vain because of religion and/or peoples personal views. 

￼

Now let’s talk finances:

The first $2,500 is going specifically to become an LLC in California ($800), and to hire a grant writer in hopes so we may not need to continue with crowdfunding.

Since that’s why our paths have crossed at this very moment, and maybe there’s a reason for that...?

I’ve been looking at budgets and figures from $50,000 to $150,000 and finding out that this is actually on the lower end, financially speaking for a fully professionally produced documentary. Yes, I want it in the festivals, on as many screens nationally, and of course the end goal being distribution.

All donations benefit the production expenses directly from marketing materials, grant writer(s), copyright clearances (the film is named after one of my favorite hymns, after all), equipment rentals, travel expenses (research and interviews), office/meeting spaces, and of course to help keep the website up and running-  www.loveoneanotherfilm.com 

And finally, an editor will have to be hired to put together my personal footage along with footage made to a paid camera crew when deemed necessary, any additional technology needed to facilitate in the production of the film, and to any other assistants or professionals who will help with the overall production including sound, lighting), and those who may aid in acquiring possible distribution rights.

*I also pledge to donating a fair portion to each non-profit who agrees to sit down with us for any assistance in acquiring the most up to date facts, stats, etc, which I'm pushing to be in a face-to-face on camera interviews.*

￼

Now some of you know due to the California Wildfires last year that swept my hometown of Santa Rosa, California (Sonoma County), I lost not only my residence, but also a laptop, a netbook, two hard drives, and an ipad. Now that doesn’t even begin to describe everything else that burned; including photos, books, journals, family videos, furnature, collectables, and SO many other personal mementos and collectible artwork.

Needless to say- these factors have set us back a bit. 

￼

Also, unexpectedly, my part time marketing job and multiple audition opportunities are taking me to NYC in October for an undetermined amount of time, which is amazing AND scary at the same time. However many of the interviews will be held in Utah (and around the world) where  I am coming across stories that I think might ultimately help others by being included in #LoveOneAnotherFillm. 

I believe in this project and am excited to meet the many people this year who will also become a part of #LoveOneAnother Family.

Which brings me to credits: 

*anyone who donates any amount will most certainly be listed in the final credits of the film.*
This also includes individuals who have tipped us off with a great story, reference, or resource.*

Some you know that I am no stranger to the film and television industry.  My full bio of screen credits can be found here IMDb  
Before I entered the world of film and television I was a professional chorus boy based in NYC, working  for whoever would pay me to sing and dance!

My mother Keli (who has also appeared in 13 Reasons Why with me, and other film projects) has agreed to come on board with me as a co-producer and we are currently calling ourselves JLH/KLH Family Productions. She attended both Rick’s College (now BYU-Idaho) and BYU in Provo, Utah and will be our admin and financial leader. She is, after all, married to a Financial Advisor, while I will continue with the creative side and conduct all of the interviews. 

Keli Lyn Hanson  is also extremely active in the LDS faith. My father was recently called to be a Bishop in the area most affected by last years fires. 

My parents are incredible leaders and living examples of how to turn tragedy into triumph. They lost our family home of 30 years when the fires mentioned above swept through Northern California. If they can survive all of that, I can certainly get this film produced!

￼
Updates and progress will of course be posted as they happens, mosly in picture and video form. After all, people like to see what they are giving to. But I will mostly likely be posting those to our official website and officially facebook page.

Thank you in advance for any consideration in helping me spread some LOVE where there is so much hate in the world.

 I am so looking forward to being on the other side of the stage and camera for a while. Who knows maybe I’ll be the next Ellen or Oprah?! Me and my big dreams... What I do know is that I want to help people and I think this is the perfect platform for just that.

Over the course of the last few days families in California have lost homes or have had to evacuate due to the California Wildfires. The fire burning in Ventura County is the largest of five fires burning in Southern California and has burned more than 150 square miles and forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people. These families have been left with a load of stress and pain during this holiday season. 

Renewed Destiny would like to do our part in helping to lift that load and hopefully by showing love, we can give our fellow citizens something to smile about this year. 

During this years Winter Wonderland (our annual holiday outreach program), we would like to help affected families with your contributions of toiletries, clothes, shoes, food and gifts for the holidays. Your generous support would be greatly appreciated.

We've recently seen multiple back-to-back disasters all over America and I believe the same approach I envisioned for the homeless can help displaced victims of California’s wild fires. When a family loses their home to a large-scale disaster, it can often take over a year to receive any manner of financial relief from an insurance company or FEMA. During this time, it is often likely that regular income is either inadequate or non-existent, as businesses and the self-employed are frequently significantly impacted.

My idea is to convert shipping containers into housing units which provide adequate space for a single person or small family to transition back into permanent housing.  Clustered in ""pods"" with additional converted containers for potable water, toilets, showers and laundry facilities, these units can be placed wherever they're needed and can be relocated anywhere a ""roll off"" truck can access.

Working directly with manufacturers like Global Portable Buildings in Santa Rosa, California, this Go Fund Me campaign is created to raise the necessary funds to convert 14 40-foot shipping containers for disaster victims. When this prototype “pod” proves to be successful, I believe it will serve as a blueprint for homeless and disaster relief in Southern California.

Recycled Love Dog Rescue (RLDR),  www.recycledlovedogrescue.org, is on the run from the raging California wildfires--displaced and desperate. The dogs are frightened, delicate and they need your support. This has been incredibly traumatic and we are doing all we can to stay calm, save our lives and save the dogs' lives. The photos are horrifying and so is the situation, but the dogs' safety and comfort is our priority. Imagine being a homeless dog, abandoned at a shelter, sick, abused, old, and scared and then saved by RLDR and finally feeling settled and safe and now THIS?! These dogs have been through so much already and we are doing all we can to comfort them in what has to be so scary and unsettling for them. We can do this and always have but we need your support in this emergency to make sure all are properly cared for, medicated, comfortable and stable. We cannot do this alone and right now we feel tired, alone and frightened and we need you. 




We are praying the Rescue Ranch survives this tragedy so we can continue to save dogs' lives but the fires are right at our back yard--literally. We need your support now truly more than ever and urgently. Can you please support our wonderful rescue in our most desperate hour?

In an incredibly tragic twist of fate, Recycled Dog Rescue has been a victim of the raging wildfires in California, with no end in sight. Our little rescue which has so many sick, old, special needs, and newborn puppies in our care has been evacuated from the Rescue Ranch. Displaced, we are doing our best to hold things together, but we unfortunately were already in DIRE need of funds, so this is truly an urgent emergency situation and we are begging for your help. Fortunately, for now we have a safe place to stay and all the dogs are all safe.

As of now, we have received word that the Rescue Ranch is still standing, but we will have so much work and added expenses ahead. There is terrible damage from the fire retardant and the water from the hoses that we cannot go back until the insurance adjuster evaluates the situation.  Every day away is exponentially more expensive and difficult. Unfortunately this also prevents us from having adoption events, or showing any dogs. This is a terrible setback for the rescue and we DESPERATELY need your help just to stay afloat right now, literally and figuratively. 

The expense just to relocate is climbing astronomically and keeping the dogs medicated, fed and safe is a huge expense and priority now. Any donations are greatly appreciated at this time. Please find it in your hearts to give and help with such a desperate situation. With much love from the fur kids XXXX

I just got married and found my first apartment, after looking long and hard to find one. It was an amazing place and we were very excited. It was the Hopper Lane, apartments. Near Coffee Park. My new wife and I just moved everything we own into our new apartment. That same night it burned to the ground and we lost everything because of the California wildfires. We were not home when it hit, and the fire spread so fast that we were unable to salvage anything at all. We did not even get to spend one night in our new place. And now our entire neighborhood is completely destroyed. We are recently married and trying to start a life together but now we just have the clothes on our back. I can't even afford to take my wife on a honeymoon anymore. Luckily we are all still alive, including our little Chihuahua named Lucky. We are devastated because many of the things we lost are irreplaceable. I like to earn my own money and normally I would never take any kind of donation but I am at my wits end and don't know what else to do. So I am making this page in hopes of getting any kind of support that will help my wife and I survive. We would spend any money we get on trying to find a new place to live, food, clothes and basically everything we need to survive. We are incredibly grateful to anyone who can spare anything for us. You are amazing and have a great heart. We can't thank you enough if you are able to help us. Even if it's just a little bit. Peace and love to all of you out there.

                        Homeless Campsite Culture: Documentary Fund",https://www.gofundme.com/homeless-documentary-and-support,Homeless Campsite Culture: Documentary Fund,"Earlier this year, I made the very difficult decision to leave my beautiful home in the Pacific Northwest because of an emergency.  It turned out to be a blessing in disguise and I’m now happily settled in a new house.  But for many, being in-between homes is a slippery descent into long-term homelessness. 

Thousands of people displaced by the recent California wildfires now face this very predicament.

I am asking for your help in telling a timely and important story, to impart some valuable lessons and to also help some stoic and resourceful people who happen to be homeless.

I made the most of my challenging transition by camping and hiking along the West Coast over the summer.  An eye-opening experience, I discovered a group of skilled and educated people who, due to no fault of their own, have been displaced and now live in managed campgrounds all year round.  These folks are not there because of common drivers like mental illness or substance abuse; they simply encountered emergencies and lost their homes.  And the daunting cost of housing makes it extremely difficult for them to recover. 

As a brief reminder, I’m a much published, award winning journalist –  https://www.2ndwindproductions.org/print – and have now pitched this story to the editors at Mother Jones where it under consideration.  I’m also developing a documentary film on this worthy subject.  The immediate goal is to shoot and edit together a short “pitch reel” to obtain funding for production.

I am currently following and concerned about three particular stories: Jillian, a 34-yr-old single mom and her three kids (pictured) who fled an abusive environment by taking off in a Dodge minivan crammed with pots and pans, sleeping bags and coloring books, Kevin, a 76-year-old retired university professor who lost everything from a life-threatening medical emergency abroad not covered by his US health insurance, and Lucas, a 30-year-old young man who didn't think twice about using the rent money to pay the urgent vet bill for his dog, and was promptly evicted.  

I was lucky.  While I ventured around the Western US, I kept working as a consultant on feature films with wifi hot spots from camps, hotels and wireless cafes.  I tackled big projects — like a romantic comedy starring James Caan and Ellen Burstyn — and my clients didn't suspect that I was living outdoors.  I’d get paid electronically, stock up on groceries and then host small gatherings at my campsite, cooking hearty meals for some of my less fortunate neighbors.  And it dawned me: the homeless-campsite-culture helps people maintain a degree of self-esteem and a semblance of personal space by renting campsites, cooking meals and developing mini communities.  For some, the campground culture provides support and a transition back into housing. 

Essential to the transition is having the capacity for empathy.  That is one of the key takeaways: We all need to take care of one another.

My goal is to get right back on the road in a weatherized camper to visit, interview and maybe help some of the people I’ve met, and others, still living outdoors in the freezing winter.  I would also travel to campgrounds around Paradise, CA to document how those people are coping.

Your donation will fund the rental of the camper and help to cover travel and other related expenses as I tour campgrounds and conduct interviews in Oregon and California.  I also need a better digital video camera - (the sensor on my SONY Z1 died) - and would gratefully accept the donation or loan of a used/working cam.  You will receive updates in writing and in vlog form, a copy of the magazine and a credit on the documentary.  You may even help some good people, displaced by random events, with blankets and food if I can raise enough.  There but for the grace of God, it could be any of us.

Like mother like daughter, they are truly the best human beings anyone could know. When something goes wrong, they are always the first to show up and the last to leave. They are the kind of people that show up with 10 pounds of food the day after your home has been robbed and sit with you until you feel both inexplicably happy and safe. They are the kind of friends that will never let go a day go by without making sure you know how loved you are. They bring you soup when you're sick, bake you birthday cakes even though you're old, and they do it all as if it requires no effort at all. They make you feel like it's a privilege to take care of you. They are wise, and sweet, and the most loving people you could hope to call family.

Debbie lives (*lived) on Mark West Springs road in Santa Rosa in the house that Melanie grew up in. Last Sunday, 10/8, Debbie woke up from a strange dream and called Melanie to relay what happened. She dreamed that Melanie was lying in a hospital bed next to her father, who (in real life) past away from Cancer many years ago. Never having spoken to her in a dream, he told her that at 1am, something was going to happen. Debbie thought this was mother's intuition and that something was going to happen to Melanie. She asked Melanie to sleep with her ringer on Sunday night, and she did the same. Very late Sunday night, before anyone ever knew there was a firing blazing through Sonoma County, Debbie's phone rang. Alarmed, she woke up to find that it was her neighbor calling to tell her that she smelled smoke. Debbie looked out the window and saw the wall of flames blazing on the hillside. Disoriented and frantic, she started to pack a bag. She tried to gather Melanie's baby pictures. The phone rang again, this time it was an official telling her there wasn't time. There wasn't time to take anything they told her, just get out. So she left the house with nothing and escaped with no time to spare.

I went to see Debbie at Melanie's apartment this week. Sitting with Melanie's 1.5 year old daughter, she told me sweetly how grateful she was that nothing had happened to her daughter or granddaughters. She even laughed telling me about the silver-lining that Melanie's older daughter Sophia had tried to cheer her up with on Monday morning ""at least you don't have to clean the house, grandma."" Her only regrets were not making it out with Melanie's baby pictures nor letters or pearls from her late husband, Melanie's father. As always, even in shock, Debbie found positivity in the wake of this incredibly traumatic event. 

Debbie works for the Rincon Valley library and has a especially painful case of Parkinson's disease. The library is not paying her while this is happening. Her health insurance is not great, and she had to switch providers in August to try and see a different neurologist to get her pain under control. The hospital where her current providers are located is not open right now due to the fires, so she is not able to get help for her condition or even an update on when her appointments will be rescheduled or moved to. 

I remember that Debbie's house was very full, not with material possessions, but with memories. Photos, drawings, items that belonged to Melanie's father...things that can't be replaced. But as I started to create a list of things she might need right now, I realized just how many things one needs to create a sense of normalcy (a hair brush, underwear, face lotion, a cloth to clean her glasses).  As I start to comprehend what rebuilding a life looks like for Santa Rosa residents, I wonder:
- where do you live and how do you live close enough to your job to make it work?
- even if your place of employment is still standing, how do you rebuild and still go to work everyday? 
- how can you possibly do 101 logistical things at once and still commit to the kind of self-care necessary to overcome the emotional devastation of this kind of event? 
- where will you find the strength AND money to recover?

So this is the start of something, to help Debbie recover and rebuild. THANK YOU endlessly for extending kindness to others, even strangers, in need.

Jason served his country for 10 years as a Marine and is an Iraq vet.

On Nov 8th fire tore through Paradise and they had to literally flee for their lives. This a New York Times  account  ‘Hell on Earth’: The First 12 Hours of California’s Deadliest Wildfire   ""The fire accelerates, consuming the equivalent of a football field every second, according to Cal Fire.""  

Their home and all their belongings were lost to the fire.  So were the kids schools, their church, their whole community. It's hard to imagine how it must feel to go through that. Mari said the day after  ""Yesterday was pure survival mode, today it is hitting us pretty hard......"".

We can never replace what they have already lost.  Our goal is 10K because we simply hope to give them a helping hand to get through the immediate aftermath. That amount will help them replace some of the critical items and meet the basics of daily life for a short period of time  - shelter, bedding, food, toiletries,  warm clothes for themselves and the kids, and so on .,.  Many of Mari's friends want to help, so we have intitated this GoFundMe as a quick, easy, and transparent way to lend a helping hand. 

$5 will buy a meal for the boys, $25 a pair of shoes, $50 a warm jacket, $100 a night in a hotel. The temperatures are already very chilly at night and the rains will be here any day.

Every penny of funds raised here* will go directly to help Mari, Jason, Colton, and Maddox.

The Camp Fire has been the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. At this writing, there have been over 79 confirmed fatalities, over 16,000 structures destroyed, and 150,000 acres burned. The Town of Paradise was destroyed, with over 1,000 people still missing.

It is estimated that over 150 first responders and their families lost their homes or suffered major damages during this fire. 

CalFire and the CDF Benevolent Foundation are reporting that over 65 firefighter families lost their homes or suffered damages from the fire.

Butte County EMS has reported that 26 of their public safety employees lost everything they own.

It has been reported that over 45 homes belonging to members of the Butte County Sheriff's Office were destroyed in the fire.

With all of these losses, there are numerous first responder families that need to rebuild from the ground up. This is our chance to show those who serve their communities how much we care about them and their families. 

100% of the funds raised from this fundraiser will go directly to the members of these three agencies (CalFire, Butte County EMS and Butte County SO). Every donation amount makes a difference, from $5 to $5000.

As many of you know, my beautiful home of California is in a state of emergency. We are experiencing the worst wildfire in history and the effects are devastating to say the least. Hundreds of thousands of acres (filled with homes, families, animals, memories, agriculture, and businesses) are being decimated as I write this. Hundreds of communities have been displaced and the death toll is only increasing. I am asking for your help during this time of need. 

Let’s band together and do our part to aid as many people/animals possible that have been affected.  

Firefighters, medical professionals, and volunteers need our help. These brave individuals are working around the clock (some longer than 24-hour shifts) in attempt to save people, land, and animals from the blazes. 

I have created this Go-Fund-Me to collect donations from my friends and family. 100% of proceeds will go to directly aid the people and animals affected by the California wildfire. 

I have selected two charities to donate too:
1. California Fire Foundation
2. VCA (to help the animals)

Go-Fund me does not do split donations, so this page is dedicated to The California Fire Foundation. Please read the descriptions below and select the one that you would like to contribute to!

For this charity, my goal is $1,250 USD, and my generous employer will match all donations! That said, the hope is to donate $2,500 in total to the California Fire Foundation. We will be setting the same goal for VCA. This means $5,000 in total to support those affected!

The California Fire Foundation provides support for firefighters and the families of those who have died while at work. This money will help us commemorate fallen heroes, offer scholarships to children of fallen firefighters, and provide aid to victims of fire or other natural disaster, ensuring that firefighters and their loved ones are forever cared for, as well as those they shelter from disaster.

The money donated to VCA will go to aiding the animals affected by the fired. They have been giving first aid to animals that have been burned or otherwise affected by the fires, and providing pet food and other supplies. The number of animals under their care has risen significantly since the wildfires starting. 

If you want to donate to The California Fire Foundation, you are on the right page!

Every penny counts. Please help me in giving back in any way possible. No amount is too small.

My name is Beth and I'm from Oceano, CA nd I am raising funds to help my friend Olivia and her family who have been going through a rough time financially and emotionally. Olivia lives with her mother who's a single-parent and her 3 younger siblings..her mother works full-time and sometimes freelances as a hairstylist. Olivia also works full-time to help her mother provide food on the table and pay the bills/rent and because of insufficient funds and time, she is not attending what would have been, her first year of college. It's also important for me to mention that Olivia also suffers from depression and severe anxiety disorders (frequent anxiety attacks) and has stopped her medications / visits to her therapist due to lack of funds. Aside from their own problems they are also dealing with the tragic lose of Olivia's aunts home in Ojai, CA due to the ongoing wildfire that has devastated thousands of people in surrounding areas as well, thus leaving their only family in California and thousands of others to rebuilds their lives and futures. Olivia and her mother have a huge heart for this earth and it's people and are always helping and giving to others even if they don't have a lot and I know this firsthand because they have been so giving to our family in our time of need. You can help me raise money by donating as much as $5. 

Donations will be equally disbursed towards Olivia's college education, family & medical costs, and the victims of the California wildfire (REDCROSS) including Olivia's aunt ..Thank you all for your time and support. May god bless you all in abundance of love and happiness!

At the height of the fires, there were over 2,500 national guards called in during one of the largest mobilizations since 9/11.

More than 100,000 people were displaced; many had to stay in evacuation centers for an extended period of time. Experience has shown that most victims of natural disasters such as the firestorms experience depression as they struggle to adjust. This depression may last for a year or more.

Sonoma Rebound Project was conceived by a small group of Santa Rosans as a way to directly support Sonoma County residents in the aftermath of the destruction and trauma.  

While most fire relief efforts focus on material assistance, Sonoma Rebound has created a unique community center and program to focus on wellness recovery, an important role to soften long term emotional impact. We seek out suitable volunteers and create workshops and events to provide healing activities and needed services. Our venue and our program make it easy for anyone to donate their professional services and share resources and skills without any obstacle or financial burden.  Watch the video above to see what we have accomplished in just 3 months.

Because of the long term impact on our community, we are committed to continue Sonoma Rebound to support the healing process as we all find our way forward. We want to help sustain the heightened sense of connection and goodwill that emerged during and immediately after the crisis.  A sense of community and connection is vital to restore well-being and resilience. We enable people to connect and help each other move forward together and individually.

We urgently ask for your support as our center needs a new location due to expiring lease. Please make a donation by clicking the ‘Donate Now’ button and share our campaign on your Facebook page.

These absolutly, devastating mudslides came just a few short weeks after the southern California summer wildfires.

I live in West Sonoma County, and over the last three days, I have seen first hand the utter devastation that the California Wildfires have created for our family, and our community. The struggles are many for those who are now faced with the fallout from such a tragic event, and it can seem insurmountable. 

The Reece family have worked tirelessly to build their lives and their dreams together. To have their home taken from them so suddenly, and to have suffered so much loss in the wake of this tragedy, is simply unimaginable and heartbreaking. 

Andrew & Rachael's home was one of the many homes destroyed by the horrific 'Coffee Park' firestorm that swept through Santa Rosa, CA on 10/08 & 10/09/17. The picture above is what remains of their home today. 

This campaign serves to provide a new sense of hope and security for an amazing young family of three, who just settled into their first home with their beautiful daughter, Kendal, only five months old. 

This fund is being created to help Andrew & Rachael find their footing again, and to begin the long process of rebuilding their home, their family, their lives, and their future. 

My name is Michael Fraher. I am Andrew and Rachael Reece's Brother-in-Law, and I will be the direct contact/liaison for this fund-raising campaign.

Calvary Chapel was one place where people lived under evacuation (including our pastors).

We were able to do A LOT but TOGETHER (with your help) WE COULD DO MORE!

While we are still inundated in smoke, and our schools remain closed, we are already preparing for our next disaster: more fires and possible mudslides.

People have been contacting us from across the nation asking how they can help.  This page and the attached video is our response in answering that question!

We only want to partner with those who care and are looking for ways to make a difference with their giving.  Calvary Chapel’s response in the midst of this crisis demonstrates that we will use your gift responsibly.

Thank you to firefighters, emergency responders, Red Cross, and local heroes of all sorts.  Thank you to everyone praying for our community from across the nation.  Thank you for all the love and support that is pouring in.  Thank you for making a tangible difference through your generous gift.

Below are some important needs that we would like you to know about:

(please watch the video for the explanation).

Estimated Costs: 

Bathroom Remodel: $2000  (desperately needed if adding more evacuees)

Storage Container: $1500    (needed to store supplies for shelter readiness)

Cots/Mats/Sleeping Bags: $1300  (many people didn’t have their own)

Air Purifiers: $2000 (clean air is desperately needed indoors due to smoke outside)

Cabinets: $2500  (to have a larger food pantry ready for people to come)

Kitchen Remodel: $30,000 (updated equipment needed for better readiness)

Generators: $1800  (essential when power was down for extended periods)            

Satellite Communications:  $1650 (a unique landlocked valley community – we needed news, internet, text messaging – accurate information is essential for safety and communicating with loved ones)

Mortgage Payoff: $500K  (important as it puts existence at risk until paid off)

I want to make clear how valuable each and every donation is. If 30 of us gave $20, or if 50 of us donated $10, that would be $500 directly helping someone in need, providing the essential tools they need to heal and get back on their feet.

Your donation really matters!

I encourage you to do research to learn about the causes and preventions of wildfires, and how to help both people and animals in a time like this. Thanks!

As most of you have heard, California wine country is in a state of emergency and it's currently being devastated by some of the worst wildfires the state has ever seen. Thousands of people are losing their homes, businesses, neighborhoods, and some are sadly losing loved ones. This really hits close to home for me, as well as most others in SF, as so many of the people affected are our friends, families, neighbors and pets.

Now it’s our duty to step up and help out! All funds raised will be donated to the following local rescue leagues in the Napa, Sonoma and Santa Rosa areas:

Humane Society
Napa Valley Community Disaster Relief Fund
Redwood Credit Union North Bay Fire Relief
United Way of Wine Country Relief Fund

And possibly other local charities (if you know of any others in need, please let me know!).

Whatever, the answer may be, it is certain that animals are an important part of our lives. They deserve love, care, and a home.

The Humane Society of Silicon Valley (HSSV) is trying to combat this situation by providing food and care for shelter animals as part of their Foster animal program. This program has been created to promote the benefits of adopting a pet over buying one. With the current wildfires in California, HSSV has been offering assistance to shelters that have been overwhelmed by countless animals that have been displaced from their homes. These efforts have been successful but will continue to need support from the public. We urge you to make a small donation to this deserving cause as any help will not go unnoticed.

Two days ago a fire started that completely devastated the town I’ve lived in my whole life. Not a single inch of Paradise CA is left, every building, home and park is ash... the town has been completely wiped off the map.

My beautiful nana just recently bought a home in Magalia a little over a year after my papa passed away. My mother and uncle were staying with her when the fire broke out and all of their belongings were in the house as well. My uncle had just finished remodeling to give my nana her dream kitchen a few days prior to the fire.

When they evacuated, they only had enough time to grab a few things, their dogs, and go. Many items remained including my papa's American flag. 

Unfortunately, their home was in the line of fire, I have received photos of their neighborhood with nothing left.

I am hoping to collect donations from anyone who can help my family during these times, for food, shelter, clothes and other living expenses till we can figure out the next step. I don’t know how much they will need so we are just thankful for anything you can do.

I love you all and even just sharing this post will help❤️

It wasn’t too long ago, just this past September, when Hurricane Florence hit the East Coast, affecting the Carolinas and many more southern states.  I remember speaking with family & friends and thinking to myself how great it is to live in DC because of there being so little tragedy that’s occurred within my life.  Yes, 9/11 was awful, one of the absolute worst but in terms of mother nature, you only hear about the southern states and west coast that are always involved whether it be a hurricane, tornado, mass flooding, wildfires etc.  

It’s likely that everyone reading this has been exposed of the media of the wildfires that are currently taking place in California.  Raw footage of innocent, helpless animals trapped and human beings gone missing.  As of 11/15/2018, the death toll has reached 59 people, with dozens of people still missing.  This is awful.  Over 125,000 acres of land completely demolished and burned.  

To think how lucky we are to live in the DC metro area is an understatement.  Granted everyone has their everyday struggles whether it be through work, relationships, personal problems but can you imagine having to fight the battle of what these citizens of California are going through.  These innocent people have lost their homes, families, pets, belonging, and the list goes on.

The Camp Fire destroyed the towns of Paradise and Magalia, CA, and took Jerry and Sue Gioia's home with it.  They have literally lost everything. There was next to no warning, as the fire was burning roughly 80 football fields a minute.  They had about 20 minutes to grab very little, get to their car and flee to safety.  They did not even have time to get Sue's mobility scooter. 


We are so thankful that they made it out alive, but as we begin to pick up the pieces, we are realizing how much help they really need.  They were underinsured, are both disabled, and are completely overwhelmed and in shock that this tragedy has struck them.  We are applying for every assistance program that we can find, and hoping that we will be able to help them through the process.  Relief programs are slow, and in the meantime, Jerry and Sue literally have nothing.  


We have had several friends and family ask us how they can help, and we feel that at this point, what would be most helpful would be for us to ask for financial assistance for them.  With donations, we hope to help secure housing for them, pay their bills, and begin to replace items lost in the fire that will not be covered by insurance.

+++++++++++
WHAT WE DO: 

This is medicine for the people, by the people.  We are providing free medicine distribution and education efforts for the Butte County community.  

-- Collect financial & herbal donations of medicine and supplies from local& regional herbalists and herb companies
-- Distribute free medicine (at the Walmart camp, to those impacted by the fire, to those being of service to take care of themselves, to those in need)
-- Educate and advocate for herbal medicine to dismantle systems of oppression and empower individuals to utilize medicine in their own lives
-- Hold table presence at the shelters and tent cities to distribute herbal remedies and educate people on how to use the medicine
-- Give medicine directly to those who lost their homes in the fire
-- Hold an educational medicine making workshop where people can take home herbal remedies they made for themselves
-- Reuse bottles for lowered economic and environmental impact



+++++++++++++
WHAT WE NEED:

We need your support to sustain this effort long-term.  The initial flood of donations has been amazing to get us going, and the purpose of this gofundme is to ensure we will have resources to sustain our efforts for at least a few more months.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BREAKDOWN OF HOW DONATIONS WILL BE SPENT: 

100% of what we get goes on the people in need.  

We have been getting lots of donations of pre-made medicines and bulk herbs, as well as some bottles and basic supplies.  We will need to buy more bottles, alcohol, vinegar, oils, containers, labels, cups, and some more herbs.

Right now, we are working out of a donated space and home kitchens, but we would like to establish an affordable & secure place for long-term medicine making.


++++++++++++
BACKGROUND:

In the aftermath of the most devastating wildfire in California history right in our backyard, we recognize the need for community resiliency. We see herbal medicine distribution and education as a long-term project to rebuild the health of our community dealing with respiratory, anxiety, depression, trauma, and more. We also recognize that the crisis of poverty and houselessness has been pre-existing in our community and do not draw a line in the herbal aid being offered.

We recognize the need for education as a tool for dismantling systems of privilege by enabling self-empowerment. This crisis hit the most vulnerable members of our community the hardest, and we acknowledge the disparity of power in our outreach efforts.

As the 6th most devastating wildfire in California history (and climbing), currently having destroyed more than 1,500 structures, it will take us quite sometime to recover. 


This disaster has hit some in our business community 
really hard. 


As our colleagues have shared from similar experience in other communities recently stricken by natural disasters, what our businesses will need now and over the next 6 months is financial support. They are hurting from forced closures, displaced employees unable to work, and business slowing with the smoke and distraction of the fire. We have begun to raise funds through our foundation, the ""Forward Redding Foundation"", to be given to local businesses adversely effected by the fire in the form of ""business recovery grants"". These one-time grants will be vetted by a small grant committee and distributed in increments up-to $5,000. The goal is to help our businesses bridge the gap created by the financial hardships related to the crisis. 


Here are the top two ways you can help:


1) Make a financial contribution to this ""Small Business Recovery Fund"".


2) Please help us to get the word out within the state, regional, and national network of Chambers that the Redding Chamber of Commerce is seeking contributions at this time. 


Here is some additional information about the Forward Redding Foundation:


The Forward Redding Foundation is a 501(c)3 private foundation with EIN: 94-3013946. The Foundation seeks to improve the economic, educational and social prosperity of the greater Redding area and Shasta County.

Authorities have confirmed 81 deaths with 13,503 residences, 514 businesses and 4,404 barns, sheds and other buildings have burned in the blaze.  The total of 18,421 structures is more than three times the toll from last fall's Tubbs Fire in Napa and Sonoma.

We considered 5 dollars as a fair amount to contribute, but if you are in a position to donate more, it will make much more difference!

The money donated through GoFundme platform is linked to the American Red Cross with the purpose of recovering from a wildfire. This process takes time and a diverse network of organizations and services to make sure people have the help they need.

WHO WE ARE:

Global Housing Assistance Coalition is a non-profit organization founded in 2008. The Coalition was created to be a resource for families and communities when misfortune arises. We offer assistance to the alarmingly high number of families who are victimized during the insurance claim process after already experiencing a catastrophic event. Our team of experts educates families and share important information to encourage smart, educated decisions as they recover from difficult situations.

WHERE WE ARE LOCATED:

We are located in Carlsbad San Diego, CA. We understand the needs of the fire victims are so much more then just a place to stay. We understand the issues that your going through and are here to help eliminate some of the delays that can occure during a catastrophic events such as these.

Non-Profit Purpose: 

Many individuals and families are not prepared for a residential major or minor disaster such as a fire, flood, or earthquake. However the massive devastation of Hurricane Katrina, and the Southern California Wildfires of 2003 and 2007 was a wake-up call to communities across our nation. Unfortunately, there are too many stories of people being taken advantage of during a crisis. By working with a GHAC trained case manager you will learn what your customer rights are and have answers to your questions throughout the insurance claim process.

Having a case manager by your side minimizes the chances of becoming a victim to those who look to profit from someone in your situation. Global Housing Assistance Coalition is an advocate for all victims who have suffered a catastrophic event. We are with you, providing guidance and assistance from the on set through the time you can move back into your home.

As our Coalition grows with community awareness and sponsorship, we continue to reach our goal of eliminating financial harm and minimizing further exposure due to a disaster.

Fund Distribution:

 The sponsorship includes providing the services that are desperitly needed to assist the victims of all catastrophic events. Due to each event having it's own needs the total amount of the funds that are received will be around 92% of it's total funds that are collected. In the case where the additional funds are needed for the operations of the  non-profit all funds will be registered within the accounting of the non-profit and available to doners. 

All additional information on funds that are bing donated to any non-profit are available through the non-profit that is accepting the funds to assist others. You can request to see where the funds are being directed and the total amount that was donated.

But right now I'm hurting hard. My paternal family, my Aunt, Uncle, Great Aunt, Cousin, and her boyfriend have lost everything.  House? Gone. Apartments? Gone. Jobs? Gone. Why? The businesses are gone too.  Context, my family is part of the #CampFire, because, you know, there are THREE currently happening in California. A snippet from an article covering this fire: ""An estimated 80 to 90 percent of Paradise (the town) was wiped out by flames Thursday night""  https://weather.com/amp/news/news/2018-11-09-northern-california-wildfire-camp-fire-paradise Right now they're staying 1.5 hours away from where they have spent the better part of the last 25 years. My aunt & uncle have insurance so the house will be rebuilt, but it'll take time. My great aunt & cousin aren't so lucky as they were renters. So they'll have to look at whatever options are available in the town after it's safe to return.  They're staying in a hotel and I honestly dont know what to do. I know they've been smart about things to the best of their ability, but everything helps when you've lost it all in my opinion. Additionally, we are still awaiting word if my maternal side Aunt, Uncle and my cousins who are still in school will have anything to return to.  Right now we're still in the dark. The silver lining of all this is that everyone is safe and healthy and we are so so so fortunate for that, but we are all hurting here. So, yea, I'm going out on a limb here and asking. I'm not good with asking but I'm going to do what i can for my family. I'm fortunate enough to have some stuff saved up and once my aunt can confirm that they can receive mail at their post office box, and that it hasn't burnt down, I'll be sending them stuff too.  But I'm asking that if you are willing to help me and my family out, if you would. If you don't have money, that's totally ok! I get it, I am not so well off to not know that feeling all too well, but if you dont mind doing the whole social media thing, I'd appreciate it. At any rate, this is getting long and I'm feeling more awkward by the moment about this, so I'm going to hush for now and just say thank you for reading.",2290,2000,35,36,82,"PARADISE, CA"," November 9, 2018",https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/34388436_1541868116407089_r.jpg,36,82,35,0.9943,2203,2000,1.145,1,0,"['geological phenomenon', 'rubble', 'disaster', 'demolition']"
